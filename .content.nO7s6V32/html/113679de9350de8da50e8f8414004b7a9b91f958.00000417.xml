					<description><![CDATA[As soon as the Russian Revolution occurred in 1917, the U.S. treated that nation as an enemy.  Although the Soviet Union was an ally with the U.S. in opposing Nazi Germany, when Japan was ready to surrender in 1945, the U.S. unnecessarily dropped two atomic bombs on Japan &#8212; partly in order to intimidate the Soviet Union.  For many decades from 1945 until the USSR collapsed in 1991, the U.S. kept treating that nation as an enemy with whom we were locked in a Cold War that was ready at any moment to destroy the entire world with nuclear weapons.  <a class="mh-excerpt-more" href="/we-need-peace-instead-of-provoking-war-with-russia" title="We need PEACE instead of provoking war with Russia.">[...]</a>]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[For many decades, politicians have been telling the American people that the U.S. is the strongest nation on earth &#8212; the mighty protector of peace and democracy and human rights and freedom &#8212; and that our military is the strongest and most powerful. But we keep losing wars &#8212; including our losses to poor nations such as Vietnam and Afghanistan. The U.S. Empire is a sham &#8212; a &#8220;Potemkin Village&#8221; &#8212; but despite its gross ineffectiveness, both political parties vigorously fund more military violence. When the U.S. clearly lost its 20-year war in Afghanistan, several savvy persons wrote articles such <a class="mh-excerpt-more" href="/the-u-s-s-defeat-in-afghanistan-reveals-the-ongoing-decline-of-u-s-empire" title="The U.S.&#8217;s defeat in Afghanistan reveals the ongoing decline of U.S. empire.">[...]</a>]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[When the U.S. was in the process of losing its 20-year war in Afghanistan – one of the poorest nations on earth – I kept thinking of similarities with the U.S.’s ongoing cruelty and violence and war crimes in Vietnam from the 1940s to 1975.  (Vietnam also was a very poor nation, but Vietnam’s people defeated the world’s most powerful military decades before Afghanistan did that to the U.S.) Mainstream U.S. news media have a very long record of kowtowing to U.S. foreign policy instead of reporting critical and true information.  Most schools’ history classes run behind schedule in the <a class="mh-excerpt-more" href="/vietnam-what-most-people-dont-know-and-similarities-to-afghanistan" title="Vietnam &#8212; What most people don&#8217;t know &#8212; And similarities to Afghanistan">[...]</a>]]></description>

Trump &#8212; and now Biden &#8212; have been making Planet Earth more dangerous. &#160; Karl Grossman, one of the world&#8217;s top experts on space weapons, wrote this powerful June 16, 2021, article on escalating U.S. warfare in space&#8221;  &#8220;New Space Force laboratory opens: A breakdown on space warfare ‘autonomy.’&#8221;  It includes this quotation:  “The U.S. imperial war project, now marching headlong into the <a class="mh-excerpt-more" href="/weaponizing-space-is-very-dangerous" title="Weaponizing space is VERY DANGEROUS!">[...]</a>]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The U.S. has a very long history of arming dictators and human rights abusers. This was already going on long before the U.S. and Britain overthrew Iran&#8217;s democracy and installed the extremely brutal Shah of Iran in 1953.  The U.S. armed that brutal dictator throughout the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s.  After the Shah&#8217;s demise, the U.S. armed Iraq&#8217;s Saddam Hussein so he could fight his war against Iran.  Then the U.S. violently overthrew him and armed many sides in the chaos that arose directly because of the U.S.&#8217;s war there.  In recent years the U.S. has armed MANY different factions <a class="mh-excerpt-more" href="/the-u-s-must-stop-arming-dictators-and-human-rights-abusers" title="The U.S. must stop arming dictators and human rights abusers">[...]</a>]]></description>
