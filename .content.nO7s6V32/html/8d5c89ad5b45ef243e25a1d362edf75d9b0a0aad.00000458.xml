					<description><![CDATA[My notes here summarize some main points of the article I’ve linked below – and add some of my own thoughts: &#160; The article I’ve linked below says that – although 70% of the public is worried about the climate – this has not translated into real organizing.  Instead of playing politics (nice words and political wheeling-dealing, but falling short of making the bold changes that are necessary, the article says we need to deepen the public’s concern with a profound “change of heart.” Instead of “transactional” politics, we need “transformative” politics.  Without a profound change of heart we’ll be <a class="mh-excerpt-more" href="/smart-insights-for-strengthening-our-organizing-for-the-climate" title="Smart insights for strengthening our organizing for the climate">[...]</a>]]></description>

New York City has joined this effort.  See this great news: https://worldbeyondwar.org/new-york-city-joins-ican-cities-appeal/?link_id=33&#38;can_id=1d662460c0abb8939c5044c82927552b&#38;source=email-wbw-news-action-we-took-over-a-pipeline-company-office&#38;email_referrer=email_1383052&#38;email_subject=wbw-news-action-solidarity &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[All of our progressive movements (for peace, the environment and climate, for human rights and social justice, etc., etc., etc.) need smart ways to reach out to other people with messages that they will be able to hear and understand. Creativity, the arts, and humor can be more powerful than hard logic and facts, because they go over and around and under the barriers that prevent some people from hearing and absorbing new ideas. Here are some examples and resources: &#160; Watch this excellent 7-minute video: Why it is best to listen to political satire.  Mainstream news media have legitimized <a class="mh-excerpt-more" href="/lets-use-more-humor-in-our-political-organizing-its-a-creative-way-to-overcome-peoples-barriers-to-fresh-ideas" title="Let&#8217;s use more HUMOR in our political organizing!

					<description><![CDATA[Nonviolent Grassroots Organizing Creates Light and Progress Glen Anderson (360) 491-9093 glenanderson@integra.net The January 2022 theme for the Olympia-based publication Works In Progress (www.olywip.org) – “Where do we find light” – is a smart question to ask.  I recommend finding light in two places:  in ourselves and in the world around us. Contrary to the cynical assumption that human beings are inherently competitive and cruel (and contrary to the religious assumption that we’re doomed by “original sin”), powerful research affirms humans inherently want to cooperate and be good to each other.  I read the book Humankind: A Hopeful History written <a class="mh-excerpt-more" href="/nonviolent-grassroots-organizing-creates-light-and-progress" title="Nonviolent Grassroots Organizing Creates Light and Progress">[...]</a>]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Just like in Orwell&#8217;s novel 1984, the U.S. government and mainstream news media suppress historical facts that would embarrass the government and media. One example is the fact that during some years in the 1980s President Reagan armed and militarily supported Iraq&#8217;s Saddam Hussein &#8212; especially to help him wage Iraq&#8217;s war against Iran (1980-1988).  A million Iranians and somewhere between 250,000 and 500,000 Iraqis died in that war. When George W. Bush and Dick Cheney were issuing propaganda in order to fool the American public, media and politicians into their totally unnecessary and illegal war against Iraq (2003 and <a class="mh-excerpt-more" href="/president-reagan-armed-and-supported-saddam-hussein" title="President Reagan armed and supported Saddam Hussein">[...]</a>]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The November 2021 episode of “Glen’s Parallax Perspectives” proposes a bold, new worldwide peace movement – and it will be much more successful if women lead it. The world is stuck in violence, militarism, systemic injustices, and ecocide.  The status quo is dominated by top-down systems of war and other kinds of injustices.  Wars do not work.  Nuclear war could instantly destroy us all.  Instead of top-down dysfunction, the world needs a very bold grassroots movement grounded in profound nonviolence.  The movement can succeed, especially if women to lead it on behalf of children and all of humanity.
