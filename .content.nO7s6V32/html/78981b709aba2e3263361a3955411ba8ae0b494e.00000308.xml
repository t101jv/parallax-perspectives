					<description><![CDATA[An Online Course on War and The Environment: Spreading Knowledge Builds Power &#160; This course could not be more important. A culture of extraction and destruction is closely tied to a culture of war. Questioning that ethos of destruction and consumption is challenging, but it has belatedly begun. Challenging a culture of militarism is even harder. The 6-week online course, War and the Environment, will run from Monday June 7 to Sunday July 18, 2021. This course will provide participants an opportunity to learn from, dialogue with, and strategize for change with experts from the bold peace organization World BEYOND War (www.worldbeyondwar.org) <a class="mh-excerpt-more" href="/learn-about-connections-between-war-and-the-environment-in-online-course-beginning-june-7" title="Learn about connections between war and the environment in ONLINE COURSE beginning June 7">[...]</a>]]></description>
