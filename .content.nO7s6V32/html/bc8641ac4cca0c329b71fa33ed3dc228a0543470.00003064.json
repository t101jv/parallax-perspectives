The final version of the bill will be determined later this year. The House bill would set spending for the Pentagon and related activities like work on nuclear warheads at the Department of Energy at an astonishing $850 billion, $37 billion more than the Pentagon even asked for in its FY2023 budget request. The vast bulk of the added funds will go to pad the bottom lines of contractors like Boeing, Lockheed Martin, and General Dynamics. Of the $37 billion in add-ons to the Pentagon\u2019s proposal, over two-thirds \u2014 or $25 billion \u2014 will go to weapons procurement and research and development, categories of funding that mostly go to contractors.
