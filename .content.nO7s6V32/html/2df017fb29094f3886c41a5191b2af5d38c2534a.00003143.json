Glen, Elliott Abrams simply isn\u2019t up to the task.<\/p>\n<p>Earlier this summer, thousands of activists spoke out against this horrible choice, but President Biden hasn&#8217;t budged. <strong>That\u2019s why, with the Senate on deck to vote on his nomination soon, we&#8217;ve got to take this demand to the U.S. Capitol.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/act.winwithoutwar.org\/go\/34272?c0=reject-abrams.SloD-M&amp;source=em20231031_1&amp;t=8&amp;akid=9368%2E372126%2EHGTtKJ\"><strong>Elliott Abrams isn\u2019t just any public servant, and this isn\u2019t just any nomination.
