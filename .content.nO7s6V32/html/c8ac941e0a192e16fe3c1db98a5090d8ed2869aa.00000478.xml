					<description><![CDATA[In the 1950s when I was growing up, I remember at home we had a SOLAR and WIND clothes dryer.  It used no fossil fuels and no electricity. Dad built it in the 1940s.  Mom operated it for decades. It was called a “clothesline.”  Every home’s back yard had one.  It was an upright metal pole with a smaller horizontal metal crossbar at the top.  30 to 40 feet away was another one with the same design.  Stretched between them were four long metal wires that constituted the clothesline. People would wash clothes, sheets, towels, etc., in the house and <a class="mh-excerpt-more" href="/in-the-1940s-my-dad-built-a-solar-clothes-dryer-mom-operated-it-for-decades" title="In the 1940s my Dad built a SOLAR clothes dryer.

					<description><![CDATA[The September 2021 interview on “Glen’s Parallax Perspectives” provides fresh information and insights into some aspects of the climate crisis that most people do not adequately understand.  Our expert guest, Jim Walsh, explained some problems and some scams that the fossil fuel companies want to fool us into accepting.  Before we ended our interview, Jim proposed some real solutions. For decades the big businesses that sell oil, natural gas and coal have been denying that they were causing the climate crisis.  The scientific proof is so overwhelming that they can&#8217;t be &#8220;climate deniers&#8221; any longer, so recently the fossil fuel <a class="mh-excerpt-more" href="/watch-and-or-read-tv-debunk-the-fossil-fuel-industrys-phony-climate-remedies" title="Watch and/or read TV:  &#8220;Debunk the Fossil Fuel Industry&#8217;s Phony Climate Remedies&#8221;">[...]</a>]]></description>
