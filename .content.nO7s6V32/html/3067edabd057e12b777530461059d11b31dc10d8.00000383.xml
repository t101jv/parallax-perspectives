					<description><![CDATA[Just like in Orwell&#8217;s novel 1984, the U.S. government and mainstream news media suppress historical facts that would embarrass the government and media. One example is the fact that during some years in the 1980s President Reagan armed and militarily supported Iraq&#8217;s Saddam Hussein &#8212; especially to help him wage Iraq&#8217;s war against Iran (1980-1988).  A million Iranians and somewhere between 250,000 and 500,000 Iraqis died in that war. When George W. Bush and Dick Cheney were issuing propaganda in order to fool the American public, media and politicians into their totally unnecessary and illegal war against Iraq (2003 and <a class="mh-excerpt-more" href="/president-reagan-armed-and-supported-saddam-hussein" title="President Reagan armed and supported Saddam Hussein">[...]</a>]]></description>

Also, you can contact President Biden through the White House website — www.whitehouse.gov/contact/ — or through the White House phone switchboard — (202) 456-1414  Grassroots pressure has produced positive governmental actions on some issues.  Let’s keep it going! &#160; HEALTH CARE: When Joe Biden was campaigning to be elected President, he promised to <a class="mh-excerpt-more" href="/click-to-urge-president-biden-to-take-these-actions-updated-to-may-3-2021" title="Click to urge President Biden to take these actions … (Updated to May 3, 2021)">[...]</a>]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[For a very long time the U.S. had a &#8220;War Department,&#8221; but we conducted very few foreign wars. In 1947 Congress changed it to the &#8220;Department of Defense,&#8221; and we have conducted many, many wars since then, including our 2-decades-long Endless War against &#8220;terrorism.&#8221; Sensible people want to replace the U.S.&#8217;s chronically aggressive and violently militaristic foreign policy. The diagram linked here can help us figure out strategies for doing that.  It is fun to bring a few friends together to work through this exercise together.  Also, it can be useful for you to work with it alone.  Creative insights <a class="mh-excerpt-more" href="/this-clever-diagram-can-help-us-strategize-how-to-change-to-a-peaceful-foreign-policy" title="This clever diagram can help us strategize how to change to a peaceful foreign policy.">[...]</a>]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In early September 2019 Trump fired his National Security Adviser John Bolton.  Bolton was a NOTORIOUS hawk who kept opposing diplomacy and kept promoting war instead.  He has been WRONG on foreign policy issues for decades.  Finally Trump had found that Bolton was too hawkish even for Trump, so Trump fired him. Here are some articles about this, including articles summarizing Bolton&#8217;s horrible record and the political context for this latest firing: &#160; #1:  John Bolton is an extremist who likes war and opposes diplomacy and international agreements.  A great non-profit organization &#8212; www.beyondthebomb.org &#8212; wrote this:  &#8220;Bolton managed to break <a class="mh-excerpt-more" href="/john-bolton-was-too-hawkish-even-for-trump" title="John Bolton was TOO HAWKISH even for Trump!">[...]</a>]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The U.S. has OVERTHROWN many governments &#8212; including many democracies. Sometimes the U.S. claims we are protecting &#8220;human rights&#8221; or restoring &#8220;democracy.&#8221; But the truth is almost always the opposite. See examples at the &#8220;Peace&#8221; and &#8220;International Affairs&#8221; parts of this blog, parallaxperspectives.org &#160; An April 22, 2019, article on www.commondreams.org exposed the U.S.&#8217;s horrible track record in the context of the Trump regime&#8217;s attempt to overthrow Venezuela&#8217;s elected president.  READ THE ARTICLE AT THIS LINK.

					<description><![CDATA[The excellent non-profit organization &#8220;Win Without War&#8221; (www.winwithoutwar.org) promotes bold and principled information and efforts for peace. On April 11, 2019, they started urging people to impeach John Bolton for several reasons. See this information and a link to tell Congress to impeach Bolton: This week marks John “Bomb ‘Em” Bolton’s one year anniversary as White House National Security Adviser. And in just a year, ultra-hawk Bolton has destroyed multiple, vital international treaties, and is dragging us inches from two wars of choice with Venezuela and Iran. But John Bolton is not a permanent fixture. In fact, he is impeachable. <a class="mh-excerpt-more" href="/act-now-tell-congress-to-impeach-bolton" title="Act Now: Tell Congress to Impeach Bolton">[...]</a>]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Soon after George W. Bush attacked Iraq in March 2003 he landed on an aircraft carrier and spoke of his triumph in front of a huge banner that proclaimed ”Mission Accomplished.” That war actually dragged on for many years, and the U.S.&#8217;s bi-partisan war against Iraq and &#8220;war against terror&#8221; actually provoked terrorism throughout the region and in many other parts of the world.  W&#8217;s war was no victory at all! Instead of the “shock and awe” against Iraq creating a decisive, powerful victory for the U.S., the long, bogged-down chaos actually showed how weak and ineffectual the U.S. is. <a class="mh-excerpt-more" href="/this-new-insightful-article-explains-really-why-george-w-bush-started-his-2003-iraq-war" title="This new, insightful article explains REALLY WHY George W.

					<description><![CDATA[When the older Bush (George H.W.) died recently, many people were praising him for all sorts of things. Actually, he did MANY BAD things, including using the racist Willie Horton ad during his presidential campaign and starting unnecessary wars and making a lot of money through his business selling military weapons, and on and on. Here are three articles that were excluded from mainstream news media: &#160; His &#8220;war for oil&#8221; in Iraq &#8212; the FIRST Gulf War &#8212; was totally unnecessary and extremely cruel.  See this: https://www.alternet.org/george-herbert-walker-bush-and-myth-good-gulf-war?src=newsletter1098436 &#160; He really was a WAR CRIMINAL.  See this: https://theintercept.com/2018/12/05/george-h-w-bush-1924-2018-american-war-criminal/?eType=EmailBlastContent&#38;eId=0c17c70c-da4f-491c-b967-6efd540d1ace &#160; Also, <a class="mh-excerpt-more" href="/despite-praise-for-the-late-george-h-w-bush-he-did-many-bad-things" title="Despite praise for the late George H.W.
