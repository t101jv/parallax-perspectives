Through its statutory mandate, OIG investigates these allegations. It makes recommendations based on findings, which it reports to Congress, but it cannot ensure the personal accountability of those responsible for misconduct. In this case, OIG made recommendations relating to strengthening policies and procedures for dealing with scientific data, disagreements, and integrity, and one recommendation \u201cto strengthen the EPA\u2019s culture of scientific integrity, transparency, and accountability of political leadership actions.\u201d EPA disagreed with all five recommendations.
