					<description><![CDATA[Mainstream news media and mainstream politicians have been misleading the public about what has caused the current inflation &#8212; and what to do about it.  They &#8212; and the Federal Reserve (the bank-owned nationwide entity that decides how much money to circulate) &#8212; misdiagnose the causes, so their remedies actually hurt ordinary people. I&#8217;m posting here some articles that provide true information, fresh insights, and suggestions for solving this economic problem in ways that help ordinary people. &#160; This video &#8212; in less than 3 minutes &#8212; DEBUNKS 4 Myths About Inflation.  Robert Reich explains economic realities in clear and <a class="mh-excerpt-more" href="/inflation-fresh-insights-debunk-conservative-myths" title="Inflation: Fresh insights debunk conservative myths">[...]</a>]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The October 2022 program on “Glen’s Parallax Perspectives” TV series “connects the dots” between poverty in the United States and excessive military spending, including the costs of nuclear weapons: This TV program begins by recognizing the extent of poverty in the United States – the richest nation on earth. Poverty is a serious crisis – and it is getting worse. Next, we recognize how excessively expensive the U.S. military has become. The U.S. spends a gigantic amount on the military – much, much more than is necessary.  Both political parties keep increasing military budgets far, far beyond reason. We spend <a class="mh-excerpt-more" href="/10392-2" title="Spending for Military and Nuclear Weapons Makes Poverty Worse &#8212; Glen’s October 2022 TV program">[...]</a>]]></description>

We can significantly strengthen this positive trend by organizing a bigger, more strategically savvy grassroots movement.  Let’s educate the public and various public and private entities.  Let’s build a grassroots movement to convince them to sell their fossil fuel investments.
