					<description><![CDATA[Nonviolent Grassroots Organizing Creates Light and Progress Glen Anderson (360) 491-9093 glenanderson@integra.net The January 2022 theme for the Olympia-based publication Works In Progress (www.olywip.org) – “Where do we find light” – is a smart question to ask.  I recommend finding light in two places:  in ourselves and in the world around us. Contrary to the cynical assumption that human beings are inherently competitive and cruel (and contrary to the religious assumption that we’re doomed by “original sin”), powerful research affirms humans inherently want to cooperate and be good to each other.  I read the book Humankind: A Hopeful History written <a class="mh-excerpt-more" href="/nonviolent-grassroots-organizing-creates-light-and-progress" title="Nonviolent Grassroots Organizing Creates Light and Progress">[...]</a>]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[When the Democratic candidate for Virginia&#8217;s governorship lost his re-election to a Trump extremists, mainstream media said &#8212; as they typically do in such cases &#8212; that the Democratic Party needs to become much more conservative.  That is a WRONG conclusion to draw from this. The Democratic incumbent was a &#8220;CORPORATE&#8221; Democrat who was already conservative.  His conservative track record as incumbent governor gave no inspiration for people to turn out.  Democrats must EARN THE VOTES by promising AND DELIVERING BOLDLY on bold issues. &#160; Election results are SYMPTOMS of what is happening &#8212; or not happening &#8212; at the <a class="mh-excerpt-more" href="/understanding-electoral-losses-on-tues-nov-2-2021" title="Understanding electoral losses on Tues.
