					<description><![CDATA[All of our progressive movements (for peace, the environment and climate, for human rights and social justice, etc., etc., etc.) need smart ways to reach out to other people with messages that they will be able to hear and understand. Creativity, the arts, and humor can be more powerful than hard logic and facts, because they go over and around and under the barriers that prevent some people from hearing and absorbing new ideas. Here are some examples and resources: &#160; Watch this excellent 7-minute video: Why it is best to listen to political satire.  Mainstream news media have legitimized <a class="mh-excerpt-more" href="/lets-use-more-humor-in-our-political-organizing-its-a-creative-way-to-overcome-peoples-barriers-to-fresh-ideas" title="Let&#8217;s use more HUMOR in our political organizing!

					<description><![CDATA[Government officials SAY nice things about the climate, but they keep failing to take meaningful actions to fix the climate crisis. Also, they try to avoid being held accountable for their negligence. CONSIDER THIS ANALOGY: Someone with a serious addiction to alcohol says he wants to cure his addiction. He says he will reduce his alcohol consumption 20% by the year 2035. He also refuses to be held accountable if he fails to reach that target. This is what most of the politicians in the polluting nations are doing about the climate. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Most of our anti-nuclear organizing efforts rely upon hard facts (often scary, alarming facts).  But other methods (art, music, etc.) can reach people in deeper, more personal ways that hard facts can’t.  We do not use humor often enough.  It has great potential to cut through what is entrenched and open people up to see things in totally fresh ways.  We need such freshness in order to escape the deadening oppression that the nuclear arms race has imposed upon society. Let’s consider how we might use humor to reach out to the public, the media, and politicians, and the military-industrial <a class="mh-excerpt-more" href="/lets-add-humor-to-our-organizing-movements-in-order-to-make-more-progress" title="Let&#8217;s add humor to our organizing movements in order to make more progress">[...]</a>]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Mohandas K. Gandhi (the Mahatma) said this:  &#8220;I claim that human mind or human society is not divided into watertight compartments called social, political and religious. All act and react upon one another.&#8221; &#160; Thich Nhat Hanh, the great Zen Buddhist mystic, said this:  What we need is not another doctrine, but an awakening that can restore our spiritual strength. What made Mahatma Gandhi&#8217;s struggle a great success was not a doctrine—not even the doctrine of nonviolence—but Gandhi himself, his way of being. A lot is written today about the doctrine of nonviolence and people everywhere are trying to apply <a class="mh-excerpt-more" href="/a-few-short-quotations-about-religious-spiritual-matters" title="A few short quotations about religious/spiritual matters">[...]</a>]]></description>

In the 1950s when I was growing up, I remember at home we had a SOLAR and WIND clothes dryer.  It used no fossil fuels and no electricity. Dad built it in the 1940s.  Mom operated it for decades. It was called a “clothesline.”  Every home’s back yard had one.  It was an upright metal pole with a smaller horizontal metal crossbar at the top.  30 to 40 feet away was another one with the same design.  Stretched between them were four long metal <a class="mh-excerpt-more" href="/brief-insights-here-see-these-issues-from-fresh-perspectives" title="Brief insights here:  See these issues from fresh perspectives!">[...]</a>]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The U.S. government keeps promoting more nuclear weapons in order to make Americans secure.  Instead of that, I propose that we ABOLISH NUCLEAR WEAPONS and INSTEAD, SIMPLY LEAVE OUR SHOES UNTIED. NEITHER POLICY PROTECTS OUR NATION, but my alternative policy offers two benefits: We will save many billions of dollars. And although either policy – nuclear weapons or untied shoelaces – could cause an accident,  if an accident occurs, tripping on shoelaces will cause much less damage than a nuclear war. PLEASE SHARE THIS MESSAGE – and share my reasoning – with other people. Also invite people to join the <a class="mh-excerpt-more" href="/nuclear-weapons-are-very-serious-but-we-need-some-humor-too" title="Nuclear weapons are very serious.
