					<description><![CDATA[Nonviolent Grassroots Organizing Creates Light and Progress Glen Anderson (360) 491-9093 glenanderson@integra.net The January 2022 theme for the Olympia-based publication Works In Progress (www.olywip.org) – “Where do we find light” – is a smart question to ask.  I recommend finding light in two places:  in ourselves and in the world around us. Contrary to the cynical assumption that human beings are inherently competitive and cruel (and contrary to the religious assumption that we’re doomed by “original sin”), powerful research affirms humans inherently want to cooperate and be good to each other.  I read the book Humankind: A Hopeful History written <a class="mh-excerpt-more" href="/nonviolent-grassroots-organizing-creates-light-and-progress" title="Nonviolent Grassroots Organizing Creates Light and Progress">[...]</a>]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[As soon as the Russian Revolution occurred in 1917, the U.S. treated that nation as an enemy.  Although the Soviet Union was an ally with the U.S. in opposing Nazi Germany, when Japan was ready to surrender in 1945, the U.S. unnecessarily dropped two atomic bombs on Japan &#8212; partly in order to intimidate the Soviet Union.  For many decades from 1945 until the USSR collapsed in 1991, the U.S. kept treating that nation as an enemy with whom we were locked in a Cold War that was ready at any moment to destroy the entire world with nuclear weapons.  <a class="mh-excerpt-more" href="/we-need-peace-instead-of-provoking-war-with-russia" title="We need PEACE instead of provoking war with Russia.">[...]</a>]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I have not yet listened to this, but I want to share it with you in case you might find it interesting and useful. I support good “truth and reconciliation commissions,” such as the one that South Africa did. Some other nations have done them too superficially to be useful. Canada did good work regarding their First Nations, and they produced significant accomplishments. &#160; https://www.npr.org/2020/10/11/922849505/healing-u-s-divides-through-truth-and-reconciliation-commissions?emci=61063094-bd0f-eb11-96f5-00155d03affc&#38;emdi=d2d85586-7410-eb11-96f5-00155d03affc&#38;ceid=882844 &#160; &#160;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[For many years I have appreciated &#8212; and used the methodology of &#8212; Marshall Rosenberg’s “Nonviolent Communication” as a way to resolve conflicts and move forward.  You can learn more by reading his book titled Nonviolent Communication and by searching the web for that title and for his name.  Also see some of his helpful YouTube videos.  Years ago he came to Olympia twice, and I went to hear him each time. Here is a useful quotation from him: &#8220;Three factors in why some of us respond violently and some of us compassionately in similar situations: The language we have <a class="mh-excerpt-more" href="/resolving-conflicts-nonviolently-here-are-several-resources" title="Resolving conflicts nonviolently:  Here are several resources.">[...]</a>]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Finally &#8212; after many decades of trying to raise the issue &#8212; the general public (including a majority of white people) finally understands that our traditional methods of policing are ENDANGERING rather than protecting public safety.  The systemic racial injustices have become so obvious that the public is willing to consider alternatives to the long-standing status quo. Some localities have been experimenting successfully with fresh, humane, sensible, and cost-saving alternatives.
