					<description><![CDATA[For many years Amnesty International has been working to abolish the death penalty worldwide. Near the end of 2021 Amnesty International reported the numbers of known executions during the year 2020.  They decreased by 26%, reaching the lowest number in more than ten years. In the U.S. executions have been trending downward for a good number of years.  Now 23 states in the U.S. and 2/3 of the countries in the world have abolished the death penalty. The numbers of executions in 2020 for the world&#8217;s major killers are as follows: China:  Thousands Iran:  246 or more Egypt:  107 or <a class="mh-excerpt-more" href="/death-penalty-worldwide-executions-declined-here-are-new-numbers-by-country" title="Death penalty worldwide:  Executions declined.
