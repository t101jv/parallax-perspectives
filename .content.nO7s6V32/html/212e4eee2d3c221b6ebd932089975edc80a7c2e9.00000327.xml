					<description><![CDATA[Nonviolent Grassroots Organizing Creates Light and Progress Glen Anderson (360) 491-9093 glenanderson@integra.net The January 2022 theme for the Olympia-based publication Works In Progress (www.olywip.org) – “Where do we find light” – is a smart question to ask.  I recommend finding light in two places:  in ourselves and in the world around us. Contrary to the cynical assumption that human beings are inherently competitive and cruel (and contrary to the religious assumption that we’re doomed by “original sin”), powerful research affirms humans inherently want to cooperate and be good to each other.  I read the book Humankind: A Hopeful History written <a class="mh-excerpt-more" href="/nonviolent-grassroots-organizing-creates-light-and-progress" title="Nonviolent Grassroots Organizing Creates Light and Progress">[...]</a>]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The November 2021 episode of “Glen’s Parallax Perspectives” proposes a bold, new worldwide peace movement – and it will be much more successful if women lead it. The world is stuck in violence, militarism, systemic injustices, and ecocide.  The status quo is dominated by top-down systems of war and other kinds of injustices.  Wars do not work.  Nuclear war could instantly destroy us all.  Instead of top-down dysfunction, the world needs a very bold grassroots movement grounded in profound nonviolence.  The movement can succeed, especially if women to lead it on behalf of children and all of humanity. Glen interviewed <a class="mh-excerpt-more" href="/proposing-a-bold-new-global-peace-movement-led-by-women" title="Proposing a Bold New Global Peace Movement Led by Women">[...]</a>]]></description>
