					<description><![CDATA[Just like in Orwell&#8217;s novel 1984, the U.S. government and mainstream news media suppress historical facts that would embarrass the government and media. One example is the fact that during some years in the 1980s President Reagan armed and militarily supported Iraq&#8217;s Saddam Hussein &#8212; especially to help him wage Iraq&#8217;s war against Iran (1980-1988).  A million Iranians and somewhere between 250,000 and 500,000 Iraqis died in that war. When George W. Bush and Dick Cheney were issuing propaganda in order to fool the American public, media and politicians into their totally unnecessary and illegal war against Iraq (2003 and <a class="mh-excerpt-more" href="/president-reagan-armed-and-supported-saddam-hussein" title="President Reagan armed and supported Saddam Hussein">[...]</a>]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[For many decades, politicians have been telling the American people that the U.S. is the strongest nation on earth &#8212; the mighty protector of peace and democracy and human rights and freedom &#8212; and that our military is the strongest and most powerful. But we keep losing wars &#8212; including our losses to poor nations such as Vietnam and Afghanistan. The U.S. Empire is a sham &#8212; a &#8220;Potemkin Village&#8221; &#8212; but despite its gross ineffectiveness, both political parties vigorously fund more military violence. When the U.S. clearly lost its 20-year war in Afghanistan, several savvy persons wrote articles such <a class="mh-excerpt-more" href="/the-u-s-s-defeat-in-afghanistan-reveals-the-ongoing-decline-of-u-s-empire" title="The U.S.&#8217;s defeat in Afghanistan reveals the ongoing decline of U.S. empire.">[...]</a>]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[When the U.S. was in the process of losing its 20-year war in Afghanistan – one of the poorest nations on earth – I kept thinking of similarities with the U.S.’s ongoing cruelty and violence and war crimes in Vietnam from the 1940s to 1975.  (Vietnam also was a very poor nation, but Vietnam’s people defeated the world’s most powerful military decades before Afghanistan did that to the U.S.) Mainstream U.S. news media have a very long record of kowtowing to U.S. foreign policy instead of reporting critical and true information.  Most schools’ history classes run behind schedule in the <a class="mh-excerpt-more" href="/vietnam-what-most-people-dont-know-and-similarities-to-afghanistan" title="Vietnam &#8212; What most people don&#8217;t know &#8212; And similarities to Afghanistan">[...]</a>]]></description>

Many of the issues we care about are HUGE issues in which WE are the UNDERDOGS.  Powerful forces created the unjust status quo &#8212; and powerful forces sustain the injustices we are trying to eliminate. Because we are the underdogs in these big issues, we need to empower ourselves and bring many people together so we can organize large nonviolent grassroots movements to solve the problems and create peaceful and just societies at the <a class="mh-excerpt-more" href="/empowering-the-progressive-movement-watch-glens-video-read-transcript-and-more-resources" title="Empowering the Progressive Movement:  Watch Glen&#8217;s video.

					<description><![CDATA[The general public, politicians and mainstream media all WRONGLY ASSUME that nuclear weapons &#8220;deter&#8221; attacks on the U.S.  This wrong assumption is nearly unanimous.  It is a HUGE BARRIER to moving them to reduce and abolish nuclear weapons.  In order to make progress toward peace, we absolutely must help the public, politicians and media LET GO OF the &#8220;deterrence&#8221; assumption. The “deterrence” assumption locks people into insisting that we must continue having nuclear weapons.  The &#8220;deterrence&#8221; assumption PREVENTS THEM FROM HEARING our messages about reducing and abolishing them. &#160; The people who are working to abolish nuclear weapons do recognize <a class="mh-excerpt-more" href="/people-wrongly-assume-nuclear-weapons-deter-attacks-on-us-lets-help-people-let-go-of-the-deterrence-assumption" title="People wrongly assume nuclear weapons &#8220;deter&#8221; attacks on us.
