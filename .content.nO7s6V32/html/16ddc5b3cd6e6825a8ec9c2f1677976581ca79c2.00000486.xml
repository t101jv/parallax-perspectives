Because we are the underdogs in these big issues, we need to empower ourselves and bring many people together so we can organize large nonviolent grassroots movements to solve the problems and create peaceful and just societies at the <a class="mh-excerpt-more" href="/empowering-the-progressive-movement-watch-glens-video-read-transcript-and-more-resources" title="Empowering the Progressive Movement:  Watch Glen&#8217;s video.

Here are some recent &#8220;action alerts&#8221; from non-profit organizations I respect and trust.  For some of them you can simply add your own name and contact information and click to send.  For others, you&#8217;ll need to remove my name and contact information before you add your own. While there are many ways we can organize for issues we care about, these &#8220;clictivist&#8221; activist opportunities are quick and easy.  Topics are listed in random order here with one or more &#8220;ACTION ALERT&#8221; opportunity <a class="mh-excerpt-more" href="/take-these-actions-now-updated-to-april-22-2021" title="TAKE THESE ACTIONS NOW &#8230; (updated to April 22, 2021)">[...]</a>]]></description>
