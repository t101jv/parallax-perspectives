In the 1950s when I was growing up, I remember at home we had a SOLAR and WIND clothes dryer.  It used no fossil fuels and no electricity. Dad built it in the 1940s.  Mom operated it for decades. It was called a “clothesline.”  Every home’s back yard had one.  It was an upright metal pole with a smaller horizontal metal crossbar at the top.  30 to 40 feet away was another one with the same design.  Stretched between them were four long metal <a class="mh-excerpt-more" href="/brief-insights-here-see-these-issues-from-fresh-perspectives" title="Brief insights here:  See these issues from fresh perspectives!">[...]</a>]]></description>

Trump&#8217;s biases increasingly overruled scientists and medical professionals.  This article does not mention the urgent need for Biden to restore honest science instead of Trumpian corruption at the Centers for Disease Control (CDC).  Trump corrupted EVERY federal agency.  Voters must demand that Biden <a class="mh-excerpt-more" href="/respect-science-base-public-policies-on-honest-science-and-envision-more-boldly-than-that-too" title="Respect science.

					<description><![CDATA[The June 2021 interview on “Glen’s Parallax Perspectives” TV series helps you understand the problems in U.S. foreign policy and some bold ways to solve those problems and support peace and justice worldwide. Two guests explored the problems and solutions: John Feffer is a Project Director working on a variety of foreign policy issues at the Institute for Policy Studies, an exceptionally savvy non-profit organization based in Washington DC. Their website is ips-dc.org.  I enjoyed reading his writings for a long time, even before I recruited him to be a guest for this interview. Metta Spencer is a retired professor <a class="mh-excerpt-more" href="/peaceful-foreign-policy-a-bold-new-agenda" title="Peaceful Foreign Policy &#8212; A Bold New Agenda">[...]</a>]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Most of us receive many e-mails urging us to take online actions to tell a governmental or business entity what to do. These are especially urgent now in early March 2021 about several different issues. &#160; #1: Tell Congress to pass a special tax on extremely rich people. Senator Elizabeth Warren and Representative Pramila Jayapal just announced their bold plan to pass a wealth tax. They&#8217;re going to need our help to pass it. Billionaires made more than $900 billion during the pandemic. Warren&#8217;s plan would create a two percent tax on assets over $50 million dollars, which would generate $2.75 <a class="mh-excerpt-more" href="/take-these-urgent-actions-in-early-march-2021" title="Take these urgent actions in early March 2021">[...]</a>]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Ever since the COVID-19 crisis occurred, I have been reading information about its origin.  The official story claimed it arose in an animal-to-human transmission at a meat market or from bats.  More recent scientific evidence has been debunking the official story and explaining how it arose from a scientific lab that was doing risky experiments and lacked adequate safety.  Here are some articles: &#160; #1: This informative article was published in Politico, a mainstream political periodical.  It reports that in 2018, American diplomats warned of risky Coronavirus experiments in a Wuhan Lab, but the Trump regime failed to listen. https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2021/03/08/josh-rogin-chaos-under-heaven-wuhan-lab-book-excerpt-474322 <a class="mh-excerpt-more" href="/covid-19s-origin-new-evidence-points-to-lab-experiments-instead-of-the-official-explanation" title="COVID-19&#8217;s origin:  New evidence points to lab experiments instead of the official explanation">[...]</a>]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[“How to Deal With the U.S.’s Current Crises” October 2020 Our nation is suffering from several extremely serious problems all at once.  The crises are deeply rooted and actually go beyond individual elected officials and political parties.  Problems include the COVID-19 pandemic, economic injustices, homelessness, excessive military spending, racial injustices, the criminal justice system, unfairness to immigration, right-wing extremism, the climate crisis, nuclear weapons, and Trumpism. Instead of merely lamenting “ain’t-it-awful,” three guests (Jean Gant Delastrada, Liz Moore, and Glen Gersmehl) provide smart insights into those problems and lift up some positive values that can help us solve them.  We <a class="mh-excerpt-more" href="/how-to-deal-with-the-u-s-s-current-crises" title="“How to Deal With the U.S.’s Current Crises”">[...]</a>]]></description>
