					<description><![CDATA[The main international non-profit organization promoting the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons is educating people worldwide.  ICAN &#8212; besides urging national governments to ratify the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons (TPNW) &#8212; is also urging state/provincial/local governments to pass resolutions supporting the Treaty. New York City has joined this effort.  See this great news: https://worldbeyondwar.org/new-york-city-joins-ican-cities-appeal/?link_id=33&#38;can_id=1d662460c0abb8939c5044c82927552b&#38;source=email-wbw-news-action-we-took-over-a-pipeline-company-office&#38;email_referrer=email_1383052&#38;email_subject=wbw-news-action-solidarity &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The movement is growing to PROHIBIT NUCLEAR WEAPONS worldwide. The Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons (TPNW) was ratified by the 50th nation in October 2020.  Since then, several more nations have ratified the Treaty.  The 57th and 58th nations ratified it in early December 2021. See information about the TPNW at www.icanw.org Mainstream news media in the U.S. are ALMOST TOTALLY IGNORING this bold, historic effort for peace, so &#8220;WE THE PEOPLE&#8221; must educate the American people and organize skillfully to promote the Treaty! &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The November 2021 global climate conference in Glasgow, Scotland, generated a lot of news.  Some news sources thought COP26 made progress.  Other news sources criticized it from several perspectives.  Here &#8212; in no particular sequence &#8212; are a variety of reports about what COP26 did and did not accomplish, and what we need to do now: (I have a few more articles, but this is enough for now.) &#160; COP26 Brought progress but also disappointment:  The United States released a slew of new climate commitments at COP26, last month&#8217;s international climate conference in Glasgow.

					<description><![CDATA[Nonviolent Grassroots Organizing Creates Light and Progress Glen Anderson (360) 491-9093 glenanderson@integra.net The January 2022 theme for the Olympia-based publication Works In Progress (www.olywip.org) – “Where do we find light” – is a smart question to ask.  I recommend finding light in two places:  in ourselves and in the world around us. Contrary to the cynical assumption that human beings are inherently competitive and cruel (and contrary to the religious assumption that we’re doomed by “original sin”), powerful research affirms humans inherently want to cooperate and be good to each other.  I read the book Humankind: A Hopeful History written <a class="mh-excerpt-more" href="/nonviolent-grassroots-organizing-creates-light-and-progress" title="Nonviolent Grassroots Organizing Creates Light and Progress">[...]</a>]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Just like in Orwell&#8217;s novel 1984, the U.S. government and mainstream news media suppress historical facts that would embarrass the government and media. One example is the fact that during some years in the 1980s President Reagan armed and militarily supported Iraq&#8217;s Saddam Hussein &#8212; especially to help him wage Iraq&#8217;s war against Iran (1980-1988).  A million Iranians and somewhere between 250,000 and 500,000 Iraqis died in that war. When George W. Bush and Dick Cheney were issuing propaganda in order to fool the American public, media and politicians into their totally unnecessary and illegal war against Iraq (2003 and <a class="mh-excerpt-more" href="/president-reagan-armed-and-supported-saddam-hussein" title="President Reagan armed and supported Saddam Hussein">[...]</a>]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[For many years Amnesty International has been working to abolish the death penalty worldwide. Near the end of 2021 Amnesty International reported the numbers of known executions during the year 2020.  They decreased by 26%, reaching the lowest number in more than ten years. In the U.S. executions have been trending downward for a good number of years.  Now 23 states in the U.S. and 2/3 of the countries in the world have abolished the death penalty. The numbers of executions in 2020 for the world&#8217;s major killers are as follows: China:  Thousands Iran:  246 or more Egypt:  107 or <a class="mh-excerpt-more" href="/death-penalty-worldwide-executions-declined-here-are-new-numbers-by-country" title="Death penalty worldwide:  Executions declined.
