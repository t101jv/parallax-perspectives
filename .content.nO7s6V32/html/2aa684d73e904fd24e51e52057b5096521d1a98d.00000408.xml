					<description><![CDATA[The main international non-profit organization promoting the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons is educating people worldwide.  ICAN &#8212; besides urging national governments to ratify the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons (TPNW) &#8212; is also urging state/provincial/local governments to pass resolutions supporting the Treaty. New York City has joined this effort.  See this great news: https://worldbeyondwar.org/new-york-city-joins-ican-cities-appeal/?link_id=33&#38;can_id=1d662460c0abb8939c5044c82927552b&#38;source=email-wbw-news-action-we-took-over-a-pipeline-company-office&#38;email_referrer=email_1383052&#38;email_subject=wbw-news-action-solidarity &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The December 2021 episode of “Glen’s Parallax Perspectives” helps people understand how water quality in Puget Sound (and bodies of water elsewhere) has been seriously hurt.  We also explain &#8212; in easy-to-understand ways &#8212; the damage to the the rivers and streams that flow into these salt waters.  Besides examining problems we also propose solutions. Glen Anderson interviewed Harry Branch, who has a solid educational background and extensive professional expertise that includes a variety of hands-on experience in fisheries, skippering boats, conducting marine science research, and more.  Harry explains the science and the practicalities &#8212; and the public policies &#8212; <a class="mh-excerpt-more" href="/understanding-environmental-water-quality-problems-and-solutions" title="Understanding Environmental Water Quality Problems and Solutions">[...]</a>]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The October 2021 episode of “Glen’s Parallax Perspectives” provides fresh information and insights into some controversies that have confused and misled many Americans about many matters, including our human rights and how our government functions. In a free society, people need to get along with each other – including people whose beliefs differ from each other – and we must protect fairness for all people.  This includes the relationships between religious beliefs and governments. During this interview an expert clarifies what religious freedom IS and what it is NOT.  We clear up confusion about the centuries-old American principle of “the <a class="mh-excerpt-more" href="/religious-freedom-what-it-is-and-what-it-is-not" title="“Religious Freedom:  What it Is – and What it Is Not”">[...]</a>]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Some governmental bodies (legislatures, local governments, etc.) begin with official prayers. Often those are required by conservative politicians. Those conservatives typically oppose &#8220;Big Government.&#8221; Ironically, they want &#8220;Big Government&#8221; to force us to pray in certain ways. Not only does that blatantly contradict their opposition to &#8220;Big Government&#8221; oppressing us, but it also blatantly undermines legitimate religion. &#160; Prayer should be personal and truly spiritual, but when &#8220;Big Government&#8221; imposes any prayer upon us, prayer is perverted and trivialized into just a meaningless ritual &#8212; a contemptible abuse by &#8220;Big Government.&#8221; Jesus told people to pray privately instead of in <a class="mh-excerpt-more" href="/government-sponsored-prayers" title="Government-sponsored prayers">[...]</a>]]></description>
