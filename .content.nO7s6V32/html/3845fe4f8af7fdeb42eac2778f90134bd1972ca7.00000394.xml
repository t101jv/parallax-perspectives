					<description><![CDATA[As soon as the Russian Revolution occurred in 1917, the U.S. treated that nation as an enemy.  Although the Soviet Union was an ally with the U.S. in opposing Nazi Germany, when Japan was ready to surrender in 1945, the U.S. unnecessarily dropped two atomic bombs on Japan &#8212; partly in order to intimidate the Soviet Union.  For many decades from 1945 until the USSR collapsed in 1991, the U.S. kept treating that nation as an enemy with whom we were locked in a Cold War that was ready at any moment to destroy the entire world with nuclear weapons.  <a class="mh-excerpt-more" href="/we-need-peace-instead-of-provoking-war-with-russia" title="We need PEACE instead of provoking war with Russia.">[...]</a>]]></description>

Trump &#8212; and now Biden &#8212; have been making Planet Earth more dangerous. &#160; Karl Grossman, one of the world&#8217;s top experts on space weapons, wrote this powerful June 16, 2021, article on escalating U.S. warfare in space&#8221;  &#8220;New Space Force laboratory opens: A breakdown on space warfare ‘autonomy.’&#8221;  It includes this quotation:  “The U.S. imperial war project, now marching headlong into the <a class="mh-excerpt-more" href="/weaponizing-space-is-very-dangerous" title="Weaponizing space is VERY DANGEROUS!">[...]</a>]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The general public, politicians and mainstream media all WRONGLY ASSUME that nuclear weapons &#8220;deter&#8221; attacks on the U.S.  This wrong assumption is nearly unanimous.  It is a HUGE BARRIER to moving them to reduce and abolish nuclear weapons.  In order to make progress toward peace, we absolutely must help the public, politicians and media LET GO OF the &#8220;deterrence&#8221; assumption. The “deterrence” assumption locks people into insisting that we must continue having nuclear weapons.  The &#8220;deterrence&#8221; assumption PREVENTS THEM FROM HEARING our messages about reducing and abolishing them. &#160; The people who are working to abolish nuclear weapons do recognize <a class="mh-excerpt-more" href="/people-wrongly-assume-nuclear-weapons-deter-attacks-on-us-lets-help-people-let-go-of-the-deterrence-assumption" title="People wrongly assume nuclear weapons &#8220;deter&#8221; attacks on us.

Two guests explored the problems and solutions: John Feffer is a Project Director working on a variety of foreign policy issues at the Institute for Policy Studies, an exceptionally savvy non-profit organization based in Washington DC. Their website is ips-dc.org.  I enjoyed reading his writings for a long time, even before I recruited him to be a guest for this interview.
