\u2013 and to abolish nuclear weapons \u2013 must also devise strategies so we can achieve peace and abolish nuclear weapons.<\/h3>\n<h3><strong>How could we adapt <u>their war-making strategies<\/u> into <u>peace-making strategies<\/u>?<\/strong>\u00a0 Below I\u2019m listing a few of the classic military strategies and asking how we could use those insights to help us devise smart strategies to abolish nuclear weapons.<\/h3>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<h4><strong> Concentrate force at the weakest link.\u00a0 <\/strong>Military strategists figure out where their adversaries are weakest and focus their attacks at those points.<\/h4>\n<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Nonviolent grassroots movements (such as the movement to abolish nuclear weapons) know that in order to change public policies we need to bring more and more people into our peace movements, so \u2013 before we can effectively \u201ctarget\u201d the government with our full nonviolent force \u2013 we must first reach out to the public (and a wide variety of constituencies and sectors within the general public) and strengthen our nonviolent movement for peace.<\/p>\n<p>Now, after nearly 77 years, the U.S. government\u2019s obsession with nuclear weapons has relied upon consent from the public that meekly allows:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>The possession of thousands of nuclear weapons<\/li>\n<li>The willingness to let our government decide when to launch them<\/li>\n<li>The enormous spending for nuclear weapons<\/li>\n<li>The persistent failure to meet civilian needs (ending poverty, providing health care, cleaning the environment, etc.)<\/li>\n<li>The ignorance and denial about the impossibility of any solution for nuclear waste related to weapons and energy<\/li>\n<li>You might be able to think of more kinds of public support beyond the five listed above<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>It\u2019s important for us to recognize that the public consent that allows these six factors about nuclear weapons is not so much an active kind of support, but <strong>mostly a silent acquiescence to a status quo<\/strong> that none of us has had a serious voice in deciding.\u00a0 The government made those decisions and imposed them upon us.\u00a0 Public consent has been engineered to be meek, compliant and quiet.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Which of the six factors I listed above are weak points in the government\u2019s program?<\/strong>\u00a0 How weak is the government\u2019s case in the powerlessness and compliance I mentioned in the paragraph immediately above?\u00a0 <strong>How could we adapt the militarists\u2019 strategy of attacking the weakest link to devise strategies to inform, inspire, and activate the public to undermine the weakest factors in the six I listed above?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>\n<h3><strong> Maintain surprise.\u00a0 Keep the initiative.\u00a0 Don\u2019t do what the opponent expects you to do.<\/strong><\/h3>\n<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>The peace movement is generally very predictable.\u00a0 We maintain a small, ongoing voice.\u00a0 We do the usual things.\u00a0 Some of our activities are practically choreographed.\u00a0 It is easy for the Military-Industrial-Congressional-Media Complex to pigeonhole us and ignore us.\u00a0 They keep us powerless \u2013 partly because we fail to strategize clever and unpredictable ways to change the power dynamics.\u00a0 We play our role as \u201cthe loyal opposition,\u201d and this allows everyone (including the public) to ignore us.<\/p>\n<p><strong>If we really want to abolish nuclear weapons, we must organize some strategically savvy surprises!<\/strong>\u00a0 Unexpected grassroots uprisings thrust issues into the public spotlight and change the political realities.\u00a0 They create opportunities expressed in the World Social Forum\u2019s slogan, <strong>\u201cAnother world is possible!\u201d<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>These surprising grassroots initiatives captured the public imagination and moved progressive issues ahead:<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>The Nuclear Weapons Freeze movement starting in town hall meetings in the NE swept across the nation.<\/li>\n<li>The Stonewall Uprising launched the modern LGBTQ movement.<\/li>\n<li>Occupy Wall Street spread throughout the U.S. and into some other nations.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>Let\u2019s take the initiative and figure out some strategically savvy surprises!<\/strong>\u00a0 What strategies and activities could we do now \u2013 and in the near future \u2013 and next after that \u2013 toward building the grassroots movement to abolish nuclear weapons?<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>\n<h3><strong> The moral factor is superior to material resources.\u00a0 <\/strong>I had not been aware of this as a military strategy.\u00a0 This certainly seems to be something we can use when we devise strategies for abolishing nuclear weapons.<\/h3>\n<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>I had not been aware of this third military strategy, so I don\u2019t know what it means.\u00a0 Let\u2019s figure this out and strategize how to take advantage of it.<\/p>\n<p>Generally the peace movement sees peace as more moral than war.\u00a0 However, the general public sees war as necessary (although unfortunate), so it sees war as practical and even morally better than letting an aggressor win (either attacking the U.S. or prevailing over another country that the U.S. feels entitled to defend).<\/p>\n<p>The peace movement \u2013 and the movement against nuclear weapons \u2013 could make more progress if we were to address \u201cthe moral factor\u201d with better insights and nuances than our simplistic self-righteousness over the war-hawks.\u00a0 Let\u2019s engage the public (and also moral authorities in the religious community and also the media and politicians) by re-framing \u201cthe moral factor\u201d and provoking a more thoughtful conversation about war, nuclear weapons, ethics, etc.<\/p>\n<h3><\/h3>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li>\n<h3><strong> Endure.\u00a0 <\/strong>The military knows that it must survive and persist until it eventually wins.\u00a0 The peace movement (and the movement against nuclear weapons) must know this too.\u00a0 We see ourselves as long-term strugglers.<\/h3>\n<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>We must devise strategies to sustain and grow the movements for peace and against nuclear weapons.\u00a0 We must endure and grow until we win.\u00a0 In addition to my series of 6 workshops that strengthen people\u2019s skills and resources for organizing nonviolent grassroots issues, I want to develop a different workshop that will specifically help people endure and persist until we win.\u00a0 Contact me if you\u2019re interested in taking
