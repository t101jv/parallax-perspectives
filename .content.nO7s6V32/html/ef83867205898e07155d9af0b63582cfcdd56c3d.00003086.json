He\u2019s cited often when leaders are trying to find common ground. But that wasn\u2019t the case when he was alive. True history tells us that he was a disruptor who didn\u2019t shy away from confrontation.<\/p>\n<p style=\"-webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased; -webkit-text-size-adjust: none;\">One way he demonstrated that disruption was through his stance on the death penalty. In 1957, at a time when few weeks went by without an execution, Dr. King was clear: \u201cCapital punishment is against\u2026the highest expression of love in the nature of God.\u201d<\/p>\n<p style=\"-webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased; -webkit-text-size-adjust: none;\">He knew that the death penalty was an undeniable extension of the legacy of lynching. Those acts are possible for the same reason that slavery was possible: in the words of Dr. King, to justify slavery early Americans \u201cdepersonalized\u201d the victims, stripping them of their humanity, and they \u201cstigmatized\u201d Blackness.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>His values led him to support socialism as a humane alternative to our dominant economic system.\u00a0 I have read a huge amount about Martin Luther King, Jr. &#8212; and I have read much about his explicitly socialist values.\u00a0 I hope more people will lift up those along with other crucial parts of his message.\u00a0 The article linked here explains why Kingian democratic socialism makes sense for progressives to pursue: <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.nationofchange.org\/2021\/04\/05\/why-kingian-democratic-socialism-is-the-best-path-forward-for-the-progressive-left\/\">https:\/\/www.nationofchange.org\/2021\/04\/05\/why-kingian-democratic-socialism-is-the-best-path-forward-for-the-progressive-left\/<\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<div class=\"mh-excerpt\"><p>When people refer to MLK as the &#8220;Reverend Dr.,&#8221; they are recognizing that he did indeed earn a Ph.D. in philosophy in addition to completing formal theological studies and being ordained.\u00a0 He thought clearly and wisely.\u00a0 Below I&#8217;m sharing with you some things he said about several different issues &#8212; and always grounded in humane ethics. &nbsp; &nbsp; On April 4, 1967, King spoke about the Vietnam war and overall U.S. foreign policy to an audience at Riverside Church in New York City.\u00a0 Many of the things he said there have been quoted widely.\u00a0 He explicitly denounced the injustices and <a class=\"mh-excerpt-more\" href=\"https:\/\/parallaxperspectives.org\/martin-luther-king-jr-said-these-things-about-various-issues\" title=\"Martin Luther King, Jr., said these things about various issues\">[&#8230;]<\/a><\/p>\n<\/div>","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"jetpack_post_was_ever_published":false,"cybocfi_hide_featured_image":""},"categories":[10,6,12,56,17,20,22,26,32,34,35,37,3,39,42,43,51],"tags":[],"jetpack_featured_media_url":"","jetpack_sharing_enabled":true,"jetpack_shortlink":"https:\/\/wp.me\/p9BxmU-2MR","jetpack_likes_enabled":true,"jetpack-related-posts":[{"id":9666,"url":"https:\/\/parallaxperspectives.org\/nonviolent-grassroots-organizing-creates-real-progress","url_meta":{"origin":10717,"position":0},"title":"Nonviolent Grassroots Organizing Creates Real Progress","date":"January 29, 2022","format":false,"excerpt":"This article explains why we can make significant progress on any of the issues we care about by organizing nonviolent grassroots movements: Nonviolent Grassroots Organizing Creates Real Progress \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0","rel":"","context":"In &quot;Climate&quot;","img":{"alt_text":"","src":"","width":0,"height":0},"classes":[]},{"id":9800,"url":"https:\/\/parallaxperspectives.org\/nonviolent-grassroots-organizing-glens-6-workshops-cover-these-topics","url_meta":{"origin":10717,"position":1},"title":"&#8220;Nonviolent Grassroots Organizing&#8221; &#8212; Glen&#8217;s 6 workshops cover these topics","date":"March 17, 2022","format":false,"excerpt":"Please see this summary of the topics I cover in these highly informative, practical, and inspiring workshops: Glen's 6 Workshops Cover These Topics \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0","rel":"","context":"In &quot;Climate&quot;","img":{"alt_text":"","src":"","width":0,"height":0},"classes":[]},{"id":857,"url":"https:\/\/parallaxperspectives.org\/profound-nonviolence-for-a-truly-just-society","url_meta":{"origin":10717,"position":2},"title":"Profound Nonviolence for a Truly Just Society","date":"May 15, 2018","format":false,"excerpt":"In slightly more than three pages, the article at this link provides wisdom, compassion, insights, and encouragement to fix our society's problems.
