					<description><![CDATA[The U.S. has a very long history of arming dictators and human rights abusers. This was already going on long before the U.S. and Britain overthrew Iran&#8217;s democracy and installed the extremely brutal Shah of Iran in 1953.  The U.S. armed that brutal dictator throughout the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s.  After the Shah&#8217;s demise, the U.S. armed Iraq&#8217;s Saddam Hussein so he could fight his war against Iran.  Then the U.S. violently overthrew him and armed many sides in the chaos that arose directly because of the U.S.&#8217;s war there.  In recent years the U.S. has armed MANY different factions <a class="mh-excerpt-more" href="/the-u-s-must-stop-arming-dictators-and-human-rights-abusers" title="The U.S. must stop arming dictators and human rights abusers">[...]</a>]]></description>

These are especially urgent now in late February 2021 about several different issues. &#160; Urge Biden to rejoin the Iran nuclear deal: The Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA, commonly known as the &#8220;Iran nuclear deal:) was working well until Trump pulled the U.S. out of it and escalated his bullying against Iran &#8212; including escalating threats of war against Iran.  Instead of getting &#8220;leverage&#8221; to force Iran to yield to Trump&#8217;s demands, Trump&#8217;s scheme backfired.  The Iranian <a class="mh-excerpt-more" href="/urgent-late-feb-2021-online-actions-for-these-issues" title="URGENT (late Feb. 2021) ONLINE ACTIONS for these issues">[...]</a>]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[For a very long time the U.S. had a &#8220;War Department,&#8221; but we conducted very few foreign wars. In 1947 Congress changed it to the &#8220;Department of Defense,&#8221; and we have conducted many, many wars since then, including our 2-decades-long Endless War against &#8220;terrorism.&#8221; Sensible people want to replace the U.S.&#8217;s chronically aggressive and violently militaristic foreign policy. The diagram linked here can help us figure out strategies for doing that.  It is fun to bring a few friends together to work through this exercise together.  Also, it can be useful for you to work with it alone.  Creative insights <a class="mh-excerpt-more" href="/this-clever-diagram-can-help-us-strategize-how-to-change-to-a-peaceful-foreign-policy" title="This clever diagram can help us strategize how to change to a peaceful foreign policy.">[...]</a>]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[A website is a source of some old TV programs and some old movies that you can watch for FREE. The October 1962 Cuban missile crisis VERY NEARLY escalated into nuclear war between the U.S. and the USSR. A Soviet submariner courageously defied his order to launch a nuclear-tipped torpedo at a U.S. warship.  That would have quickly escalated into global destruction. A powerful movie about this runs about 53 minutes.  CLICK THIS LINK: https://retrovision.tv/man-who-saved-the-world-the-2011/ &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;]]></description>
