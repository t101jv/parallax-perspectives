					<description><![CDATA[The December 2021 episode of “Glen’s Parallax Perspectives” helps people understand how water quality in Puget Sound (and bodies of water elsewhere) has been seriously hurt.  We also explain &#8212; in easy-to-understand ways &#8212; the damage to the the rivers and streams that flow into these salt waters.  Besides examining problems we also propose solutions. Glen Anderson interviewed Harry Branch, who has a solid educational background and extensive professional expertise that includes a variety of hands-on experience in fisheries, skippering boats, conducting marine science research, and more.  Harry explains the science and the practicalities &#8212; and the public policies &#8212; <a class="mh-excerpt-more" href="/understanding-environmental-water-quality-problems-and-solutions" title="Understanding Environmental Water Quality Problems and Solutions">[...]</a>]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The November 2021 episode of “Glen’s Parallax Perspectives” proposes a bold, new worldwide peace movement – and it will be much more successful if women lead it. The world is stuck in violence, militarism, systemic injustices, and ecocide.  The status quo is dominated by top-down systems of war and other kinds of injustices.  Wars do not work.  Nuclear war could instantly destroy us all.  Instead of top-down dysfunction, the world needs a very bold grassroots movement grounded in profound nonviolence.  The movement can succeed, especially if women to lead it on behalf of children and all of humanity.

					<description><![CDATA[The October 2021 episode of “Glen’s Parallax Perspectives” provides fresh information and insights into some controversies that have confused and misled many Americans about many matters, including our human rights and how our government functions. In a free society, people need to get along with each other – including people whose beliefs differ from each other – and we must protect fairness for all people.  This includes the relationships between religious beliefs and governments. During this interview an expert clarifies what religious freedom IS and what it is NOT.  We clear up confusion about the centuries-old American principle of “the <a class="mh-excerpt-more" href="/religious-freedom-what-it-is-and-what-it-is-not" title="“Religious Freedom:  What it Is – and What it Is Not”">[...]</a>]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The article with the headline and the link below said this part-way through the article, because Biden’s Trumpian stupidity was not the article’s main point.  The article said Biden urged OPEC to DRILL MORE OIL because he was worried that a reduced supply of oil would increase oil prices and hurt the economic “recovery.” The article’s main point is that instead of taking honest, effective actions to sharply reduce climate chaos, fossil fuel companies are promoting high-tech gimmicks that are not really effective but will fool the public and governments – and keep enriching their own profits – while delaying <a class="mh-excerpt-more" href="/after-ipccs-alarming-report-demanding-sharp-reductions-biden-urged-opec-to-increase-drilling-for-oil" title="After IPCC&#8217;s alarming report demanding sharp reductions, Biden urged OPEC to INCREASE DRILLING FOR OIL!!!">[...]</a>]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The September 2021 interview on “Glen’s Parallax Perspectives” provides fresh information and insights into some aspects of the climate crisis that most people do not adequately understand.  Our expert guest, Jim Walsh, explained some problems and some scams that the fossil fuel companies want to fool us into accepting.  Before we ended our interview, Jim proposed some real solutions. For decades the big businesses that sell oil, natural gas and coal have been denying that they were causing the climate crisis.  The scientific proof is so overwhelming that they can&#8217;t be &#8220;climate deniers&#8221; any longer, so recently the fossil fuel <a class="mh-excerpt-more" href="/watch-and-or-read-tv-debunk-the-fossil-fuel-industrys-phony-climate-remedies" title="Watch and/or read TV:  &#8220;Debunk the Fossil Fuel Industry&#8217;s Phony Climate Remedies&#8221;">[...]</a>]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The August 2021 interview on “Glen’s Parallax Perspectives” provides the public with information and insights about something that almost no Americans know much about.  We discuss the U.S.’s testing of nuclear weapons in the Marshall Islands in the Pacific Ocean from 1946 to 1958. Below you see the links so you can WATCH THE VIDEO and/or READ THE THOROUGH SUMMARY that I typed up.  We explain the facts clearly so the viewers of the video &#8212; and the readers of the typed summary &#8212; will clear understand what happened.  We especially explain how the U.S.&#8217;s 67 nuclear tests affected the <a class="mh-excerpt-more" href="/marshall-islanders-still-suffer-from-u-s-nuclear-weapons-testing-1946-1958" title="Marshall Islanders Still Suffer from U.S. Nuclear Weapons Testing (1946-1958)">[...]</a>]]></description>

Many of the issues we care about are HUGE issues in which WE are the UNDERDOGS.  Powerful forces created the unjust status quo &#8212; and powerful forces sustain the injustices we are trying to eliminate. Because we are the underdogs in these big issues, we need to empower ourselves and bring many people together so we can organize large nonviolent grassroots movements to solve the problems and create peaceful and just societies at the <a class="mh-excerpt-more" href="/empowering-the-progressive-movement-watch-glens-video-read-transcript-and-more-resources" title="Empowering the Progressive Movement:  Watch Glen&#8217;s video.
