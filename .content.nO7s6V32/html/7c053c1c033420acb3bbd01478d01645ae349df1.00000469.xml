					<description><![CDATA[This background helps you understand the controversy: Our nation is suffering from a number of huge problems that need huge solutions.  But instead of solving the problems, the right wing and the Republican Party keep promoting fear and hatred and ignorance.  They have no practical solutions for the problems, so they want to distract the public and promote cruelty. Recently the right wing and the Republican Party have become obsessed with denouncing Critical Race Theory.  Actually, CRT has existed for decades but was not noticed until right-wingers started publicizing it in grossly false ways. Law school professors developed Critical Race <a class="mh-excerpt-more" href="/understand-what-critical-race-theory-really-is-counter-the-right-wing-lies-about-it" title="Understand what Critical Race Theory really is.

					<description><![CDATA[When the Democratic candidate for Virginia&#8217;s governorship lost his re-election to a Trump extremists, mainstream media said &#8212; as they typically do in such cases &#8212; that the Democratic Party needs to become much more conservative.  That is a WRONG conclusion to draw from this. The Democratic incumbent was a &#8220;CORPORATE&#8221; Democrat who was already conservative.  His conservative track record as incumbent governor gave no inspiration for people to turn out.  Democrats must EARN THE VOTES by promising AND DELIVERING BOLDLY on bold issues. &#160; Election results are SYMPTOMS of what is happening &#8212; or not happening &#8212; at the <a class="mh-excerpt-more" href="/understanding-electoral-losses-on-tues-nov-2-2021" title="Understanding electoral losses on Tues.

					<description><![CDATA[The &#8220;conventional wisdom&#8221; wants you to think that long prison sentences make the rest of us safe.  That is NOT true.  Long prison sentences &#8212; especially life sentences &#8212; are horribly cruel and unjust in many ways. An excellent source of information is The Sentencing Project, www.sentencingproject.org.  They conduct excellent quality research and advocacy to reduce and eliminate the gross injustices in criminal justice sentencing.  I have read their materials and donated financial support for many years. In April 2021 they reported this:  &#8220;One in seven people in prison &#8212; over 200,000 individuals &#8212; are serving a sentence of life <a class="mh-excerpt-more" href="/life-sentences-are-horribly-cruel-and-unjust-in-many-ways" title="Life sentences are horribly cruel and unjust in many ways">[...]</a>]]></description>
