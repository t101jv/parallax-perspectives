					<description><![CDATA[The Establishment &#8212; mainstream culture, politicians, media, and other parts of the status quo &#8212; keeps seeing the world in conventional ways that keep perpetuating the world&#8217;s problems.  In order to change the world in better ways, we need to start seeing things differently.  Put one finger in front of your nose and another finger farther away.  Close one eye.  Then open it and close the other.  Your fingers will seem to move.  This is called a &#8220;parallax&#8221; view.  This blog addresses a wide variety of issues and invites people to look at them from fresh perspectives.  Enjoy looking at <a class="mh-excerpt-more" href="/what-does-parallax-mean" title="What does &#8220;parallax&#8221; mean?">[...]</a>]]></description>
