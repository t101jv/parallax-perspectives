					<description><![CDATA[Many times every day now I receive e-mails from various parts of the Democratic Party asking me to donate money.  Their opening request invites me to choose my favorite presidential candidates &#8212; and sometimes to identify the issues that I care about the most. They list many DOMESTIC issues (jobs, gay rights, college debt, etc.), but ALMOST NEVER ASK ABOUT FOREIGN POLICY or the federal budget&#8217;s domination by military spending or the U.S.&#8217;s perpetual violations of human rights around the world. This implies that THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY IS WILLING TO GO ALONG WITH TRUMP&#8217;S FOREIGN POLICY!

					<description><![CDATA[Just now I responded to an e-mail survey sent out by a prominent nationwide non-profit org that works to reduce gun violence throughout the U.S. They asked what their top priority should be. I said they should work to stop all of the U.S.&#8217;s war’ and de-militarize our foreign policy. I told them that the U.S.’s addiction to war and military violence create a culture that assumes shooting people is a good way to solve problems. The U.S.’s persistent militarism sets the tone for gun violence within the U.S. This really is “the elephant in the room” that the anti-gun <a class="mh-excerpt-more" href="/groups-working-to-reduce-gun-violence-always-neglect-to-oppose-war-and-military-violence-which-set-the-tone-for-gun-violence-within-the-u-s" title="Groups working to reduce gun violence ALWAYS NEGLECT to oppose war and military violence, which set the tone for gun violence within the U.S.">[...]</a>]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[For many decades U.S. foreign policy has been bi-partisan, reflecting the needs of U.S. business corporations around the world, and grounded in the myth of &#8220;entitlement&#8221; and &#8220;U.S. Exceptionalism,&#8221; the notions that the U.S. is unique in history in being the world&#8217;s ultimate savior, and therefore not bound by international law, and not subject to the constraints and realities that have confined other nations that were not the one Beacon of Liberty to save the world. The elite people who have shaped U.S. foreign policy for many decades share those assumptions, even if they have educations from elite universities and <a class="mh-excerpt-more" href="/u-s-govts-best-and-brightest-keep-pushing-us-into-unwinnable-wars" title="U.S. govt&#8217;s &#8220;best and brightest&#8221; keep pushing us into unwinnable wars">[...]</a>]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[For decades the Cold War allowed our nation&#8217;s militarists &#8212; and the weapons manufacturing corporations that fund them &#8212; to stampede the U.S. media and politicians and public into decades of recklessly wasteful military spending, including several wars and proxy wars and thousands of nuclear weapons.  They said that this is Priority #1, so we could not afford bold efforts to end poverty, take care of the environment, or do other crucial work. When the Cold War ended, those same vested interests &#8212; our nation&#8217;s militarists and the weapons manufacturers &#8212; and conservative elements that opposed solving our nation&#8217;s social <a class="mh-excerpt-more" href="/stop-the-endless-wars-repeal-the-2001-aumf" title="Stop the Endless Wars.

					<description><![CDATA[Powerful interests run their agenda on two tracks: 1. For public consumption, they say nice propaganda, platitudes, etc., and they also put out a carnival of entertainment, scandal, eye candy, etc. 2. Meanwhile, apart from public view they do horrible things. So, for example, while LBJ and Nixon kept saying they wanted peace in Vietnam, they actually were escalating the war. Trump promised jobs, promised to “drain the swamp,” etc., but he has been doing the opposite. Both parties do this, and so does big business with “greenwashing” advertising campaigns while they hurt the environment. We must pay attention to <a class="mh-excerpt-more" href="/despite-trumps-behavioral-distractions-he-is-accomplishing-much-but-the-wrong-stuff" title="Despite Trump&#8217;s behavioral distractions, he is accomplishing MUCH &#8212; but the WRONG stuff!">[...]</a>]]></description>
