Like, even more than usual.<\/p>\n<p>The national data weren\u2019t out yet, so Fox\u2019s coverage of blood-soaked Democratic cities wasn\u2019t based on empiricism, it was anecdotal.

So hold onto your hats like you would in downtown Portland because guess what?

Well, not <em>totally <\/em>stopped, but this-much stopped:<\/p>\n<p>Now, there <em>is<\/em> a (weak) defense of Fox to be made here. I\u2019m not exonerating them, mind you, I just think it\u2019s important to understand the dynamics, because they\u2019re not unique to Fox.<\/p>\n<p>In a runup to an election, you tend to focus on issues and stories relevant to who\u2019s in charge.

But homicides and other violent crime? Down from 2021:<\/p>\n<p>In fact, as you can see, both violent crimes overall and homicides specifically were at higher rates when Trump left office than when he took office. And if anyone on the left or the right was inclined to blame Democrats for the rise in crime before we knew whether it was real, I can\u2019t wait to hear them credit Democrats for the <em>drop<\/em> in crime now that we know <em>it <\/em>was real.<\/p>\n<p>And if you\u2019re enjoying these Washington Post charts, I\u2019m gonna give you one more so you can rest assured that everyone older than 30 has known a considerably more dangerous nation than the one we live in today.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>You can connect with me on <a href=\"https:\/\/ct.klclick.com\/f\/a\/zVnJDana2QeiQ3Wfx_AKow~~\/AASl5QA~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_i\">Twitter<\/a> or <a href=\"https:\/\/ct.klclick.com\/f\/a\/JCwDT62Aub6RQ8qpkYOUYQ~~\/AASl5QA~\/RgRnEPgeP4SNAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZhY2Vib29rLmNvbS9Kb25hdGhhbkxhcnNlbkpvdXJuYWxpc3Q_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-I~\">Facebook<\/a>, or drop me an email me at <a href=\"mailto:newsletters@tyt.com\">newsletters@tyt.com<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Go get &#8217;em, kids!<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<\/tbody>\n<\/table>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<div class=\"mh-excerpt\"><p>Very often, conservatives and complicit (negligent) mainstream media want to frighten us about something.\u00a0 Very often, the fears they are promoting are based on propaganda and lies.\u00a0 They want to frighten us and stampede us into bad &#8220;solutions&#8221;
