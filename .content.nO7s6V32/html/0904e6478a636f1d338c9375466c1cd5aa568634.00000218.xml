					<description><![CDATA[The main international non-profit organization promoting the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons is educating people worldwide.  ICAN &#8212; besides urging national governments to ratify the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons (TPNW) &#8212; is also urging state/provincial/local governments to pass resolutions supporting the Treaty. New York City has joined this effort.  See this great news: https://worldbeyondwar.org/new-york-city-joins-ican-cities-appeal/?link_id=33&#38;can_id=1d662460c0abb8939c5044c82927552b&#38;source=email-wbw-news-action-we-took-over-a-pipeline-company-office&#38;email_referrer=email_1383052&#38;email_subject=wbw-news-action-solidarity &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The movement is growing to PROHIBIT NUCLEAR WEAPONS worldwide. The Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons (TPNW) was ratified by the 50th nation in October 2020.  Since then, several more nations have ratified the Treaty.  The 57th and 58th nations ratified it in early December 2021. See information about the TPNW at www.icanw.org Mainstream news media in the U.S. are ALMOST TOTALLY IGNORING this bold, historic effort for peace, so &#8220;WE THE PEOPLE&#8221; must educate the American people and organize skillfully to promote the Treaty! &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[All of our progressive movements (for peace, the environment and climate, for human rights and social justice, etc., etc., etc.) need smart ways to reach out to other people with messages that they will be able to hear and understand. Creativity, the arts, and humor can be more powerful than hard logic and facts, because they go over and around and under the barriers that prevent some people from hearing and absorbing new ideas. Here are some examples and resources: &#160; Watch this excellent 7-minute video: Why it is best to listen to political satire.  Mainstream news media have legitimized <a class="mh-excerpt-more" href="/lets-use-more-humor-in-our-political-organizing-its-a-creative-way-to-overcome-peoples-barriers-to-fresh-ideas" title="Let&#8217;s use more HUMOR in our political organizing!
