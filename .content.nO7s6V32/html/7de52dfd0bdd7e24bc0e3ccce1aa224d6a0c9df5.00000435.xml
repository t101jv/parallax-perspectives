					<description><![CDATA[The November 2021 global climate conference in Glasgow, Scotland, generated a lot of news.  Some news sources thought COP26 made progress.  Other news sources criticized it from several perspectives.  Here &#8212; in no particular sequence &#8212; are a variety of reports about what COP26 did and did not accomplish, and what we need to do now: (I have a few more articles, but this is enough for now.) &#160; COP26 Brought progress but also disappointment:  The United States released a slew of new climate commitments at COP26, last month&#8217;s international climate conference in Glasgow.

					<description><![CDATA[Just like in Orwell&#8217;s novel 1984, the U.S. government and mainstream news media suppress historical facts that would embarrass the government and media. One example is the fact that during some years in the 1980s President Reagan armed and militarily supported Iraq&#8217;s Saddam Hussein &#8212; especially to help him wage Iraq&#8217;s war against Iran (1980-1988).  A million Iranians and somewhere between 250,000 and 500,000 Iraqis died in that war. When George W. Bush and Dick Cheney were issuing propaganda in order to fool the American public, media and politicians into their totally unnecessary and illegal war against Iraq (2003 and <a class="mh-excerpt-more" href="/president-reagan-armed-and-supported-saddam-hussein" title="President Reagan armed and supported Saddam Hussein">[...]</a>]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The article with the headline and the link below said this part-way through the article, because Biden’s Trumpian stupidity was not the article’s main point.  The article said Biden urged OPEC to DRILL MORE OIL because he was worried that a reduced supply of oil would increase oil prices and hurt the economic “recovery.” The article’s main point is that instead of taking honest, effective actions to sharply reduce climate chaos, fossil fuel companies are promoting high-tech gimmicks that are not really effective but will fool the public and governments – and keep enriching their own profits – while delaying <a class="mh-excerpt-more" href="/after-ipccs-alarming-report-demanding-sharp-reductions-biden-urged-opec-to-increase-drilling-for-oil" title="After IPCC&#8217;s alarming report demanding sharp reductions, Biden urged OPEC to INCREASE DRILLING FOR OIL!!!">[...]</a>]]></description>
