					<description><![CDATA[The June 2021 interview on “Glen’s Parallax Perspectives” TV series helps you understand the problems in U.S. foreign policy and some bold ways to solve those problems and support peace and justice worldwide. Two guests explored the problems and solutions: John Feffer is a Project Director working on a variety of foreign policy issues at the Institute for Policy Studies, an exceptionally savvy non-profit organization based in Washington DC. Their website is ips-dc.org.  I enjoyed reading his writings for a long time, even before I recruited him to be a guest for this interview. Metta Spencer is a retired professor <a class="mh-excerpt-more" href="/peaceful-foreign-policy-a-bold-new-agenda" title="Peaceful Foreign Policy &#8212; A Bold New Agenda">[...]</a>]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Many non-profit organizations are urging President Biden to take smart actions for many important issues.  Here are TWO informative resources about NUCLEAR WEAPONS in the post-Trump era. &#160; Resource #1: A very few of us from the Olympia Coalition to Abolish Nuclear Weapons participated in a powerfully informative Zoom meeting that the Arms Control Association (www.armscontrol.org) conducted last week about “Nuclear Challenges for the Biden Administration in the First 100 Days” and the ACA’s related report.  You may download their report from their website at this link:  available for download Also, the ACA recorded their fascinating and informative Zoom meeting, <a class="mh-excerpt-more" href="/nuclear-weapons-what-we-need-to-know-and-what-biden-should-do" title="Nuclear weapons:  What we need to know &#8212; and what Biden should do">[...]</a>]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Trump radically escalated the dangers of nuclear war. Biden can reduce those dangers IF WE URGE BIDEN TO TAKE SMART ACTIONS. &#160; This morning I was one of more than 400 persons who participated in a worldwide Zoom meeting conducted by the Arms Control Association (www.armscontrol.org).  They titled this event, “Nuclear Challenges for the Biden Administration in the First 100 Days.” They efficiently presented a lot of information from several experts.  They recorded the Zoom event and will post it to their website reasonably soon. Recently the Arms Control Association presented their new report, which was titled  he speakers will <a class="mh-excerpt-more" href="/biden-should-take-these-smart-actions-toward-nuclear-disarmament-in-his-first-100-days" title="Biden should take these smart actions toward nuclear disarmament in his first 100 days">[...]</a>]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This blog&#8217;s &#8220;Nuclear Weapons&#8221; category has included a number of posts about the truly exciting, historic Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons&#8221; (TPNW).  Read those for background.  Now here is what&#8217;s new: In October 2020 Honduras became the 50th nation to ratify the treaty.  The treaty specifies that it will go into effect 90 days after the 50th nation has ratified it.  That means the TPNW will go into effect on January 22, 2021. The national level of Physicians for Social Responsibility (www.psr.org) celebrated the 50th ratification:  https://www.psr.org/blog/psr-celebrates-50-ratifications-for-the-ban-treaty/?emci=8508afcb-b313-eb11-96f5-00155d03affc&#38;emdi=bc8e3199-9b18-eb11-96f5-00155d03bda0&#38;ceid=135885 Currently 51 nations have ratified the Treaty.  More nations are making progress <a class="mh-excerpt-more" href="/three-more-nations-ratified-the-u-n-treaty-prohibiting-nuclear-weapons" title="Now 51 nations have ratified the U.N. treaty prohibiting nuclear weapons.">[...]</a>]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[For a very long time the U.S. had a &#8220;War Department,&#8221; but we conducted very few foreign wars. In 1947 Congress changed it to the &#8220;Department of Defense,&#8221; and we have conducted many, many wars since then, including our 2-decades-long Endless War against &#8220;terrorism.&#8221; Sensible people want to replace the U.S.&#8217;s chronically aggressive and violently militaristic foreign policy. The diagram linked here can help us figure out strategies for doing that.  It is fun to bring a few friends together to work through this exercise together.  Also, it can be useful for you to work with it alone.  Creative insights <a class="mh-excerpt-more" href="/this-clever-diagram-can-help-us-strategize-how-to-change-to-a-peaceful-foreign-policy" title="This clever diagram can help us strategize how to change to a peaceful foreign policy.">[...]</a>]]></description>
