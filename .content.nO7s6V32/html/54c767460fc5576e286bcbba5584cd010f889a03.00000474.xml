					<description><![CDATA[My notes here summarize some main points of the article I’ve linked below – and add some of my own thoughts: &#160; The article I’ve linked below says that – although 70% of the public is worried about the climate – this has not translated into real organizing.  Instead of playing politics (nice words and political wheeling-dealing, but falling short of making the bold changes that are necessary, the article says we need to deepen the public’s concern with a profound “change of heart.” Instead of “transactional” politics, we need “transformative” politics.  Without a profound change of heart we’ll be <a class="mh-excerpt-more" href="/smart-insights-for-strengthening-our-organizing-for-the-climate" title="Smart insights for strengthening our organizing for the climate">[...]</a>]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Nonviolent Grassroots Organizing Creates Light and Progress Glen Anderson (360) 491-9093 glenanderson@integra.net The January 2022 theme for the Olympia-based publication Works In Progress (www.olywip.org) – “Where do we find light” – is a smart question to ask.  I recommend finding light in two places:  in ourselves and in the world around us. Contrary to the cynical assumption that human beings are inherently competitive and cruel (and contrary to the religious assumption that we’re doomed by “original sin”), powerful research affirms humans inherently want to cooperate and be good to each other.  I read the book Humankind: A Hopeful History written <a class="mh-excerpt-more" href="/nonviolent-grassroots-organizing-creates-light-and-progress" title="Nonviolent Grassroots Organizing Creates Light and Progress">[...]</a>]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The October 2021 episode of “Glen’s Parallax Perspectives” provides fresh information and insights into some controversies that have confused and misled many Americans about many matters, including our human rights and how our government functions. In a free society, people need to get along with each other – including people whose beliefs differ from each other – and we must protect fairness for all people.  This includes the relationships between religious beliefs and governments. During this interview an expert clarifies what religious freedom IS and what it is NOT.  We clear up confusion about the centuries-old American principle of “the <a class="mh-excerpt-more" href="/religious-freedom-what-it-is-and-what-it-is-not" title="“Religious Freedom:  What it Is – and What it Is Not”">[...]</a>]]></description>
