					<description><![CDATA[My notes here summarize some main points of the article I’ve linked below – and add some of my own thoughts: &#160; The article I’ve linked below says that – although 70% of the public is worried about the climate – this has not translated into real organizing.  Instead of playing politics (nice words and political wheeling-dealing, but falling short of making the bold changes that are necessary, the article says we need to deepen the public’s concern with a profound “change of heart.” Instead of “transactional” politics, we need “transformative” politics.  Without a profound change of heart we’ll be <a class="mh-excerpt-more" href="/smart-insights-for-strengthening-our-organizing-for-the-climate" title="Smart insights for strengthening our organizing for the climate">[...]</a>]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Just like in Orwell&#8217;s novel 1984, the U.S. government and mainstream news media suppress historical facts that would embarrass the government and media. One example is the fact that during some years in the 1980s President Reagan armed and militarily supported Iraq&#8217;s Saddam Hussein &#8212; especially to help him wage Iraq&#8217;s war against Iran (1980-1988).  A million Iranians and somewhere between 250,000 and 500,000 Iraqis died in that war. When George W. Bush and Dick Cheney were issuing propaganda in order to fool the American public, media and politicians into their totally unnecessary and illegal war against Iraq (2003 and <a class="mh-excerpt-more" href="/president-reagan-armed-and-supported-saddam-hussein" title="President Reagan armed and supported Saddam Hussein">[...]</a>]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This background helps you understand the controversy: Our nation is suffering from a number of huge problems that need huge solutions.  But instead of solving the problems, the right wing and the Republican Party keep promoting fear and hatred and ignorance.  They have no practical solutions for the problems, so they want to distract the public and promote cruelty. Recently the right wing and the Republican Party have become obsessed with denouncing Critical Race Theory.  Actually, CRT has existed for decades but was not noticed until right-wingers started publicizing it in grossly false ways. Law school professors developed Critical Race <a class="mh-excerpt-more" href="/understand-what-critical-race-theory-really-is-counter-the-right-wing-lies-about-it" title="Understand what Critical Race Theory really is.

Many of the issues we care about are HUGE issues in which WE are the UNDERDOGS.  Powerful forces created the unjust status quo &#8212; and powerful forces sustain the injustices we are trying to eliminate. Because we are the underdogs in these big issues, we need to empower ourselves and bring many people together so we can organize large nonviolent grassroots movements to solve the problems and create peaceful and just societies at the <a class="mh-excerpt-more" href="/empowering-the-progressive-movement-watch-glens-video-read-transcript-and-more-resources" title="Empowering the Progressive Movement:  Watch Glen&#8217;s video.

The “deterrence” assumption locks people into insisting that we must continue having nuclear weapons.  The &#8220;deterrence&#8221; assumption PREVENTS THEM FROM HEARING our messages about reducing and abolishing them. &#160; The people who are working to abolish nuclear weapons do recognize <a class="mh-excerpt-more" href="/people-wrongly-assume-nuclear-weapons-deter-attacks-on-us-lets-help-people-let-go-of-the-deterrence-assumption" title="People wrongly assume nuclear weapons &#8220;deter&#8221; attacks on us.
