					<description><![CDATA[For many years Amnesty International has been working to abolish the death penalty worldwide. Near the end of 2021 Amnesty International reported the numbers of known executions during the year 2020.  They decreased by 26%, reaching the lowest number in more than ten years. In the U.S. executions have been trending downward for a good number of years.  Now 23 states in the U.S. and 2/3 of the countries in the world have abolished the death penalty. The numbers of executions in 2020 for the world&#8217;s major killers are as follows: China:  Thousands Iran:  246 or more Egypt:  107 or <a class="mh-excerpt-more" href="/death-penalty-worldwide-executions-declined-here-are-new-numbers-by-country" title="Death penalty worldwide:  Executions declined.

					<description><![CDATA[In the past few years I have posted to my blog&#8217;s category about Military Service, Recruitment, the Draft, etc. some news about the danger that the military draft might be expanded to include (and oppress) women equally with men.  Instead of copying those links here, you can see those posts at that category of my blog. Here is what&#8217;s new now: &#160; On September 3, 2021, the Quaker-based lobbying organization &#8220;Friends Committee on National Legislation&#8221; (www.fcnl.org) reported this: Amendment Approved to Include Women in Draft:  The House Armed Services Committee approved an amendment requiring women to register for the draft. <a class="mh-excerpt-more" href="/prevent-congress-from-drafting-women" title="Prevent Congress from drafting women!">[...]</a>]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The October 2021 episode of “Glen’s Parallax Perspectives” provides fresh information and insights into some controversies that have confused and misled many Americans about many matters, including our human rights and how our government functions. In a free society, people need to get along with each other – including people whose beliefs differ from each other – and we must protect fairness for all people.  This includes the relationships between religious beliefs and governments. During this interview an expert clarifies what religious freedom IS and what it is NOT.  We clear up confusion about the centuries-old American principle of “the <a class="mh-excerpt-more" href="/religious-freedom-what-it-is-and-what-it-is-not" title="“Religious Freedom:  What it Is – and What it Is Not”">[...]</a>]]></description>
