Nevertheless, a No Labels ticket could swing critical swing states like Arizona, Nevada, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Georgia, and Michigan to Trump. No Labels is courting voters who are dissatisfied with Trump and Biden. According to <a href=\"https:\/\/substack.com\/redirect\/c5e1c79a-c5cd-4422-a0bd-d99cb74caba5?j=eyJ1IjoiZDR3NSJ9.dZvZKQSXUAiIgbZGubtPyyjYrUi7HXXyki-HsD2id9I\">an analysis by Third Way<\/a>, a centrist organization that opposes No Labels\u2019 plan, voters in 2020 that disliked both candidates voted for Biden over Trump by a margin of 15 points.

A more plausible outcome is the No Labels ticket secures enough Electoral College votes to deny either party an outright majority. That means that <a href=\"https:\/\/substack.com\/redirect\/63b8da45-76e2-48ce-8a4c-138a80ca245d?j=eyJ1IjoiZDR3NSJ9.dZvZKQSXUAiIgbZGubtPyyjYrUi7HXXyki-HsD2id9I\">the House of Representatives would elect the next the president<\/a>, with each state delegation receiving one vote.

At the event, New Hampshire state Rep. Stephen Stepanek (R), who was representing Trump, said he believed that all of the principles promoted by No Labels &#8220;fit under the label, Make America Great Again.&#8221; The event also celebrated four other Republican candidates, and one Democrat, former Maryland Governor Martin O&#8217;Malley.<\/p>\n<p>O&#8217;Malley used his address to criticize No Labels for including Trump. &#8220;When Donald Trump says all immigrants are rapists and criminals, that&#8217;s not being a problem solver,&#8221; O&#8217;Malley said. &#8220;\u200b\u200bThere are other adjectives for that \u2013 one of them being \u2018racist\u2019&#8230; I would encourage you not to dumb down this label.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Last year, No Labels criticized the January 6 Committee \u2014 a group of Democrats and Republicans investigating Trump for inciting a violent attack on the U.S. Capitol \u2014 as &#8220;<a href=\"https:\/\/substack.com\/redirect\/b220a811-3d00-4d6d-b26a-4e1bc0809190?j=eyJ1IjoiZDR3NSJ9.dZvZKQSXUAiIgbZGubtPyyjYrUi7HXXyki-HsD2id9I\">a partisan exercise about which the public is skeptical<\/a>.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>A No Labels video, which was produced before the Committee held public hearings, said the Committee was &#8220;unlikely to produce results that will bring the country together.&#8221; It compared the Committee unfavorably to the highly-partisan Republican special committee that investigated the 2012 Benghazi attack on a U.S. embassy. It said the fact that, according to one poll, only 23% of Republicans supported the Committee&#8217;s work proved it was ineffective.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>No Labels history of opposing Biden<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>No Labels publicly opposed Biden\u2019s Build Back Better (BBB) legislation, the signature legislative proposal of the Biden administration. The package, which originally included efforts to combat climate change, increase the corporate tax rate, expand the Child Tax Credit, and improve healthcare, was copiously cut down from Biden\u2019s original proposal, largely due to opposition from Senators Joe Manchin (D-WV) and Kyrsten Sinema (I-AZ).<\/p>\n<p>Throughout the legislative process, No Labels stood by Manchin and Sinema and applauded their efforts to kill the legislation.
