					<description><![CDATA[Mohandas K. Gandhi (the Mahatma) said this:  &#8220;I claim that human mind or human society is not divided into watertight compartments called social, political and religious. All act and react upon one another.&#8221; &#160; Thich Nhat Hanh, the great Zen Buddhist mystic, said this:  What we need is not another doctrine, but an awakening that can restore our spiritual strength.
