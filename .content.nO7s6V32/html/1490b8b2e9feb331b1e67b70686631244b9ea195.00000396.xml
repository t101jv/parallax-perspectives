					<description><![CDATA[The U.S. has a very long history of arming dictators and human rights abusers. This was already going on long before the U.S. and Britain overthrew Iran&#8217;s democracy and installed the extremely brutal Shah of Iran in 1953.  The U.S. armed that brutal dictator throughout the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s.  After the Shah&#8217;s demise, the U.S. armed Iraq&#8217;s Saddam Hussein so he could fight his war against Iran.  Then the U.S. violently overthrew him and armed many sides in the chaos that arose directly because of the U.S.&#8217;s war there.  In recent years the U.S. has armed MANY different factions <a class="mh-excerpt-more" href="/the-u-s-must-stop-arming-dictators-and-human-rights-abusers" title="The U.S. must stop arming dictators and human rights abusers">[...]</a>]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[President Biden has done some good things for the climate, some good things for immigrants, and some other good things.  But in many ways he is continuing his decades-long history as a middle-of-the-road Cold War &#8220;centrist&#8221; subservient to big business.  We must push Biden to support PEACE and ECONOMIC JUSTICE. Here are a few PEACE issues that the American people &#8212; and Biden &#8212; need to understand: &#160; #1.  Iran: Biden campaigned with promises that his foreign policy would rely on diplomacy first.  But instead, he appointed to very powerful positions a huge number of severe war-hawks, and he seems <a class="mh-excerpt-more" href="/joe-biden-has-a-long-history-of-supporting-militarism-and-wars-we-must-urge-him-to-support-peace" title="Joe Biden has a LONG HISTORY of supporting militarism and wars.

					<description><![CDATA[For a very long time the U.S. had a &#8220;War Department,&#8221; but we conducted very few foreign wars. In 1947 Congress changed it to the &#8220;Department of Defense,&#8221; and we have conducted many, many wars since then, including our 2-decades-long Endless War against &#8220;terrorism.&#8221; Sensible people want to replace the U.S.&#8217;s chronically aggressive and violently militaristic foreign policy. The diagram linked here can help us figure out strategies for doing that.  It is fun to bring a few friends together to work through this exercise together.  Also, it can be useful for you to work with it alone.  Creative insights <a class="mh-excerpt-more" href="/this-clever-diagram-can-help-us-strategize-how-to-change-to-a-peaceful-foreign-policy" title="This clever diagram can help us strategize how to change to a peaceful foreign policy.">[...]</a>]]></description>

On October 24, 2019, Just Foreign Policy (www.justforeignpolicy.org) sent this information.  See the end for a link to click so you can sign the petition to Congress. President Trump now claims that his “justification” for keeping U.S. troops at the al-Tanf base in southern Syria – where they will be protecting zero Kurdish civilians, who live in northern Syria – is to “protect oil.” This is unconstitutional, because Congress never authorized it. Under Article I of the Constitution and <a class="mh-excerpt-more" href="/trump-is-waging-a-new-war-for-oil-in-northern-syria-sign-petition-to-congress" title="Trump is waging a new war for oil in northern Syria.

					<description><![CDATA[Many, many different factions are fighting each other in Syria.  The U.S. is funding several of the factions that are fighting each other.  The U.S. should not participate in the complex civil war.  But Trump made a serious mistake by moving U.S. military troops from one area where they were fighting with the Kurds against a common enemy, so they could fight in a different part of Syria in order to protect somebody&#8217;s oil. Trump keeps screwing the U.S.&#8217;s allies and helping brutal autocrats.  Trump&#8217;s Syria decisions helped Russia&#8217;s Putin and Turkey&#8217;s Erdogan.

He fooled some people into thinking he was withdrawing troops from Syria as a matter of a principled peace policy.  Actually, he was screwing our allies in his &#8220;America First&#8221; isolationism &#8212; except that he is really abusing our foreign and military policies in order to help his pals Erdogan (the brutal authoritarian who runs Turkey) and Putin (&#8217;nuff said!) and in order to pursue a war for oil in Northern Syria.

Sometimes the U.S. claims we are protecting &#8220;human rights&#8221; or restoring &#8220;democracy.&#8221; But the truth is almost always the opposite. See examples at the &#8220;Peace&#8221; and &#8220;International Affairs&#8221; parts of this blog, parallaxperspectives.org &#160; An April 22, 2019, article on www.commondreams.org exposed the U.S.&#8217;s horrible track record in the context of the Trump regime&#8217;s attempt to overthrow Venezuela&#8217;s elected president.  READ THE ARTICLE AT THIS LINK.

					<description><![CDATA[News coverage about General Mattis’s resignation as Secretary of Defense is surreal. They keep saying that Mattis was a stabilizing “adult” in Trump’s regime. But Mattis is an EXTREME HAWK known as “Mad Dog.”  He resigned because Trump decided to remove U.S. troops from Syria and to reduce U.S. troops in Afghanistan.  Those are small steps in the right direction.  Trump is no dove, but these modest steps reduce the reckless hawkishness in U.S. foreign policy. When Mattis resigns over those modest steps – and when mainstream media and bi-partisan members of Congress support Mattis’s extreme hawkishness instead of Trump’s <a class="mh-excerpt-more" href="/rescue-u-s-foreign-policy-from-all-hawks-including-trump" title="Rescue U.S. foreign policy from ALL hawks including Trump">[...]</a>]]></description>
