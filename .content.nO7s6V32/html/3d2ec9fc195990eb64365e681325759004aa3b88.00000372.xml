					<description><![CDATA[When the U.S. was in the process of losing its 20-year war in Afghanistan – one of the poorest nations on earth – I kept thinking of similarities with the U.S.’s ongoing cruelty and violence and war crimes in Vietnam from the 1940s to 1975.  (Vietnam also was a very poor nation, but Vietnam’s people defeated the world’s most powerful military decades before Afghanistan did that to the U.S.) Mainstream U.S. news media have a very long record of kowtowing to U.S. foreign policy instead of reporting critical and true information.  Most schools’ history classes run behind schedule in the <a class="mh-excerpt-more" href="/vietnam-what-most-people-dont-know-and-similarities-to-afghanistan" title="Vietnam &#8212; What most people don&#8217;t know &#8212; And similarities to Afghanistan">[...]</a>]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The August 2021 interview on “Glen’s Parallax Perspectives” provides the public with information and insights about something that almost no Americans know much about.  We discuss the U.S.’s testing of nuclear weapons in the Marshall Islands in the Pacific Ocean from 1946 to 1958. Below you see the links so you can WATCH THE VIDEO and/or READ THE THOROUGH SUMMARY that I typed up.  We explain the facts clearly so the viewers of the video &#8212; and the readers of the typed summary &#8212; will clear understand what happened.  We especially explain how the U.S.&#8217;s 67 nuclear tests affected the <a class="mh-excerpt-more" href="/marshall-islanders-still-suffer-from-u-s-nuclear-weapons-testing-1946-1958" title="Marshall Islanders Still Suffer from U.S. Nuclear Weapons Testing (1946-1958)">[...]</a>]]></description>

Many of the issues we care about are HUGE issues in which WE are the UNDERDOGS.  Powerful forces created the unjust status quo &#8212; and powerful forces sustain the injustices we are trying to eliminate. Because we are the underdogs in these big issues, we need to empower ourselves and bring many people together so we can organize large nonviolent grassroots movements to solve the problems and create peaceful and just societies at the <a class="mh-excerpt-more" href="/empowering-the-progressive-movement-watch-glens-video-read-transcript-and-more-resources" title="Empowering the Progressive Movement:  Watch Glen&#8217;s video.

					<description><![CDATA[Evidence of Trump&#8217;s cruelty keeps popping up. This just came up about Trump&#8217;s attempt to deliberately undercount undocumented immigrants in the 2020 census. That would not only weaken their political presence, but it would also hurt the communities where they live. The U.S. Constitution REQUIRES an ACCURATE census of ALL persons living in the U.S.  Trump&#8217;s perversion is unconstitutional. See this:  https://campaignlegal.org/update/clc-reveals-internal-trump-administration-strategies-exclude-immigrants-census &#160; Now here is an irony:  Ironically, Trump&#8217;s inaccurate census might have actually hurt Republicans. See this:  https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2021/4/29/2028069/-Many-are-wondering-if-Trump-botched-the-Census-It-would-be-perfectly-on-brand?detail=emaildkre &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;]]></description>
