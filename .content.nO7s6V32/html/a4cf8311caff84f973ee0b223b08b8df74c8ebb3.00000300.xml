					<description><![CDATA[As soon as the Russian Revolution occurred in 1917, the U.S. treated that nation as an enemy.  Although the Soviet Union was an ally with the U.S. in opposing Nazi Germany, when Japan was ready to surrender in 1945, the U.S. unnecessarily dropped two atomic bombs on Japan &#8212; partly in order to intimidate the Soviet Union.  For many decades from 1945 until the USSR collapsed in 1991, the U.S. kept treating that nation as an enemy with whom we were locked in a Cold War that was ready at any moment to destroy the entire world with nuclear weapons.  <a class="mh-excerpt-more" href="/we-need-peace-instead-of-provoking-war-with-russia" title="We need PEACE instead of provoking war with Russia.">[...]</a>]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The article with the headline and the link below said this part-way through the article, because Biden’s Trumpian stupidity was not the article’s main point.  The article said Biden urged OPEC to DRILL MORE OIL because he was worried that a reduced supply of oil would increase oil prices and hurt the economic “recovery.” The article’s main point is that instead of taking honest, effective actions to sharply reduce climate chaos, fossil fuel companies are promoting high-tech gimmicks that are not really effective but will fool the public and governments – and keep enriching their own profits – while delaying <a class="mh-excerpt-more" href="/after-ipccs-alarming-report-demanding-sharp-reductions-biden-urged-opec-to-increase-drilling-for-oil" title="After IPCC&#8217;s alarming report demanding sharp reductions, Biden urged OPEC to INCREASE DRILLING FOR OIL!!!">[...]</a>]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The &#8220;national security&#8221; baloney that has caused many stupid, endless wars &#8212; and the extremely dangerous nuclear weapons arms race since the 1940s &#8212; is escalating into space, regardless of the 1967 treaty that prohibits militarizing space. Trump &#8212; and now Biden &#8212; have been making Planet Earth more dangerous. &#160; Karl Grossman, one of the world&#8217;s top experts on space weapons, wrote this powerful June 16, 2021, article on escalating U.S. warfare in space&#8221;  &#8220;New Space Force laboratory opens: A breakdown on space warfare ‘autonomy.’&#8221;  It includes this quotation:  “The U.S. imperial war project, now marching headlong into the <a class="mh-excerpt-more" href="/weaponizing-space-is-very-dangerous" title="Weaponizing space is VERY DANGEROUS!">[...]</a>]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The U.S. has a very long history of arming dictators and human rights abusers. This was already going on long before the U.S. and Britain overthrew Iran&#8217;s democracy and installed the extremely brutal Shah of Iran in 1953.  The U.S. armed that brutal dictator throughout the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s.  After the Shah&#8217;s demise, the U.S. armed Iraq&#8217;s Saddam Hussein so he could fight his war against Iran.  Then the U.S. violently overthrew him and armed many sides in the chaos that arose directly because of the U.S.&#8217;s war there.  In recent years the U.S. has armed MANY different factions <a class="mh-excerpt-more" href="/the-u-s-must-stop-arming-dictators-and-human-rights-abusers" title="The U.S. must stop arming dictators and human rights abusers">[...]</a>]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Trump kept pulling the U.S. out of treaties and international collaboration.  He wanted an egocentric &#8220;America First&#8221; policy that actually interfered with solving global problems. Now President Biden is doing somewhat better on some issues, but he appointed a great many war-hawks to powerful positions, and he keeps taking his advice to pursue militarism and nationalism instead of collaborating well as one nation among nearly 200 on Planet Earth.  A number of knowledgeable persons have said that Biden&#8217;s foreign policy is pretty much the same as Trump&#8217;s President Biden has promised action to protect the climate, but in order to <a class="mh-excerpt-more" href="/the-perils-of-an-america-first-climate-policy" title="The Perils of an “America First” Climate Policy">[...]</a>]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[For many years the Pentagon – in violation of federal law – has NOT passed a real audit. The Pentagon keeps failing to be accountable to presidents or to Congress or to the taxpayers. Congress and presidents keep failing to hold the Pentagon accountable. Voters keep failing to hold Congress and presidents accountable. We need a strong grassroots movement. &#160; We have known about this problem for many years.  Bernie Sanders is making a new push now.  See the article linked here.
