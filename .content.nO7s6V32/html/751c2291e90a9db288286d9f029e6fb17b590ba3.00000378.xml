					<description><![CDATA[Just like in Orwell&#8217;s novel 1984, the U.S. government and mainstream news media suppress historical facts that would embarrass the government and media. One example is the fact that during some years in the 1980s President Reagan armed and militarily supported Iraq&#8217;s Saddam Hussein &#8212; especially to help him wage Iraq&#8217;s war against Iran (1980-1988).  A million Iranians and somewhere between 250,000 and 500,000 Iraqis died in that war. When George W. Bush and Dick Cheney were issuing propaganda in order to fool the American public, media and politicians into their totally unnecessary and illegal war against Iraq (2003 and <a class="mh-excerpt-more" href="/president-reagan-armed-and-supported-saddam-hussein" title="President Reagan armed and supported Saddam Hussein">[...]</a>]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The U.S. has a very long history of arming dictators and human rights abusers. This was already going on long before the U.S. and Britain overthrew Iran&#8217;s democracy and installed the extremely brutal Shah of Iran in 1953.  The U.S. armed that brutal dictator throughout the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s.  After the Shah&#8217;s demise, the U.S. armed Iraq&#8217;s Saddam Hussein so he could fight his war against Iran.  Then the U.S. violently overthrew him and armed many sides in the chaos that arose directly because of the U.S.&#8217;s war there.  In recent years the U.S. has armed MANY different factions <a class="mh-excerpt-more" href="/the-u-s-must-stop-arming-dictators-and-human-rights-abusers" title="The U.S. must stop arming dictators and human rights abusers">[...]</a>]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The June 2021 interview on “Glen’s Parallax Perspectives” TV series helps you understand the problems in U.S. foreign policy and some bold ways to solve those problems and support peace and justice worldwide. Two guests explored the problems and solutions: John Feffer is a Project Director working on a variety of foreign policy issues at the Institute for Policy Studies, an exceptionally savvy non-profit organization based in Washington DC. Their website is ips-dc.org.  I enjoyed reading his writings for a long time, even before I recruited him to be a guest for this interview.

					<description><![CDATA[President Biden has done some good things for the climate, some good things for immigrants, and some other good things.  But in many ways he is continuing his decades-long history as a middle-of-the-road Cold War &#8220;centrist&#8221; subservient to big business.  We must push Biden to support PEACE and ECONOMIC JUSTICE. Here are a few PEACE issues that the American people &#8212; and Biden &#8212; need to understand: &#160; #1.  Iran: Biden campaigned with promises that his foreign policy would rely on diplomacy first.  But instead, he appointed to very powerful positions a huge number of severe war-hawks, and he seems <a class="mh-excerpt-more" href="/joe-biden-has-a-long-history-of-supporting-militarism-and-wars-we-must-urge-him-to-support-peace" title="Joe Biden has a LONG HISTORY of supporting militarism and wars.

					<description><![CDATA[Many Americans are confused about what has been happening with Iran. American politicians and news media have seriously misled the public and planted false narratives in our heads. Today I clearly summarized the relevant history and context from the past few decades and put it in the document I&#8217;m posting below. This document provides background and context for U.S. relations with Iran – including information about the “Iran Nuclear Deal” (the JCPOA).  It includes links so you can urge the U.S. government to support peace with Iran.

					<description><![CDATA[Most of us receive many e-mails urging us to take online actions to tell a governmental or business entity what to do. These are especially urgent now in early March 2021 about several different issues. &#160; #1: Tell Congress to pass a special tax on extremely rich people. Senator Elizabeth Warren and Representative Pramila Jayapal just announced their bold plan to pass a wealth tax. They&#8217;re going to need our help to pass it. Billionaires made more than $900 billion during the pandemic. Warren&#8217;s plan would create a two percent tax on assets over $50 million dollars, which would generate $2.75 <a class="mh-excerpt-more" href="/take-these-urgent-actions-in-early-march-2021" title="Take these urgent actions in early March 2021">[...]</a>]]></description>

Biden can reduce those dangers IF WE URGE BIDEN TO TAKE SMART ACTIONS. &#160; This morning I was one of more than 400 persons who participated in a worldwide Zoom meeting conducted by the Arms Control Association (www.armscontrol.org).  They titled this event, “Nuclear Challenges for the Biden Administration in the First 100 Days.” They efficiently presented a lot of information from several experts.  They recorded the Zoom event and will post it to their website reasonably soon.
