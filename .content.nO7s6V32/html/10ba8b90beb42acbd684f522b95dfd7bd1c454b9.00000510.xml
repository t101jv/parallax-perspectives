Recently the right wing and the Republican Party have become obsessed with denouncing Critical Race Theory.  Actually, CRT has existed for decades but was not noticed until right-wingers started publicizing it in grossly false ways. Law school professors developed Critical Race <a class="mh-excerpt-more" href="/understand-what-critical-race-theory-really-is-counter-the-right-wing-lies-about-it" title="Understand what Critical Race Theory really is.

					<description><![CDATA[In the past few years I have posted to my blog&#8217;s category about Military Service, Recruitment, the Draft, etc. some news about the danger that the military draft might be expanded to include (and oppress) women equally with men.  Instead of copying those links here, you can see those posts at that category of my blog. Here is what&#8217;s new now: &#160; On September 3, 2021, the Quaker-based lobbying organization &#8220;Friends Committee on National Legislation&#8221; (www.fcnl.org) reported this: Amendment Approved to Include Women in Draft:  The House Armed Services Committee approved an amendment requiring women to register for the draft. <a class="mh-excerpt-more" href="/prevent-congress-from-drafting-women" title="Prevent Congress from drafting women!">[...]</a>]]></description>
