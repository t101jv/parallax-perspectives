					<description><![CDATA[This background helps you understand the controversy: Our nation is suffering from a number of huge problems that need huge solutions.  But instead of solving the problems, the right wing and the Republican Party keep promoting fear and hatred and ignorance.  They have no practical solutions for the problems, so they want to distract the public and promote cruelty. Recently the right wing and the Republican Party have become obsessed with denouncing Critical Race Theory.  Actually, CRT has existed for decades but was not noticed until right-wingers started publicizing it in grossly false ways. Law school professors developed Critical Race <a class="mh-excerpt-more" href="/understand-what-critical-race-theory-really-is-counter-the-right-wing-lies-about-it" title="Understand what Critical Race Theory really is.

					<description><![CDATA[As soon as the Russian Revolution occurred in 1917, the U.S. treated that nation as an enemy.  Although the Soviet Union was an ally with the U.S. in opposing Nazi Germany, when Japan was ready to surrender in 1945, the U.S. unnecessarily dropped two atomic bombs on Japan &#8212; partly in order to intimidate the Soviet Union.  For many decades from 1945 until the USSR collapsed in 1991, the U.S. kept treating that nation as an enemy with whom we were locked in a Cold War that was ready at any moment to destroy the entire world with nuclear weapons.  <a class="mh-excerpt-more" href="/we-need-peace-instead-of-provoking-war-with-russia" title="We need PEACE instead of provoking war with Russia.">[...]</a>]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[When the Democratic candidate for Virginia&#8217;s governorship lost his re-election to a Trump extremists, mainstream media said &#8212; as they typically do in such cases &#8212; that the Democratic Party needs to become much more conservative.  That is a WRONG conclusion to draw from this. The Democratic incumbent was a &#8220;CORPORATE&#8221; Democrat who was already conservative.  His conservative track record as incumbent governor gave no inspiration for people to turn out.  Democrats must EARN THE VOTES by promising AND DELIVERING BOLDLY on bold issues. &#160; Election results are SYMPTOMS of what is happening &#8212; or not happening &#8212; at the <a class="mh-excerpt-more" href="/understanding-electoral-losses-on-tues-nov-2-2021" title="Understanding electoral losses on Tues.
