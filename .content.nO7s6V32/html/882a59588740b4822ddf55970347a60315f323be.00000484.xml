					<description><![CDATA[As soon as the Russian Revolution occurred in 1917, the U.S. treated that nation as an enemy.  Although the Soviet Union was an ally with the U.S. in opposing Nazi Germany, when Japan was ready to surrender in 1945, the U.S. unnecessarily dropped two atomic bombs on Japan &#8212; partly in order to intimidate the Soviet Union.  For many decades from 1945 until the USSR collapsed in 1991, the U.S. kept treating that nation as an enemy with whom we were locked in a Cold War that was ready at any moment to destroy the entire world with nuclear weapons.  <a class="mh-excerpt-more" href="/we-need-peace-instead-of-provoking-war-with-russia" title="We need PEACE instead of provoking war with Russia.">[...]</a>]]></description>

Trump &#8212; and now Biden &#8212; have been making Planet Earth more dangerous. &#160; Karl Grossman, one of the world&#8217;s top experts on space weapons, wrote this powerful June 16, 2021, article on escalating U.S. warfare in space&#8221;  &#8220;New Space Force laboratory opens: A breakdown on space warfare ‘autonomy.’&#8221;  It includes this quotation:  “The U.S. imperial war project, now marching headlong into the <a class="mh-excerpt-more" href="/weaponizing-space-is-very-dangerous" title="Weaponizing space is VERY DANGEROUS!">[...]</a>]]></description>
