Now these two members of Congress have reintroduced the Second Look Act.\u00a0 A previous reform had allowed this federal prisoner to become free.\u00a0 Now he works for profound justice for other people.<\/p>\n<p>The Second Look Act is ambitious and groundbreaking. It would allow people who have served at least 10 years in federal prison to petition a court to take a \u201csecond look\u201d at their sentence and assess their rehabilitation and whether their continued incarceration serves the interests of justice. It would create a rebuttable presumption of release for people who are 50 years of age or older, meaning the burden shifts to the government to demonstrate why that person should remain behind bars.<\/p>\n<p>Extreme sentences also come with a profound human cost as people spend decades in cruel conditions, separated from their loved ones. And the research is clear: as people grow and mature, they typically stop engaging in crime. There are many reasons for this, but lengthy sentences aren\u2019t one of them. They produce diminishing returns on public safety and waste scarce public resources on keeping people in prison long past the time when they pose a risk to the community. Instead, we should be funding things that make communities safer.<\/p>\n<p>For more information contact <a href=\"https:\/\/sentencingproject.org\"><strong>https:\/\/sentencingproject.org<\/strong><\/a>.\u00a0 Click <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/click.everyaction.com\/k\/55641504\/382306253\/-1711959540?nvep=ew0KICAiVGVuYW50VXJpIjogIm5ncHZhbjovL3Zhbi9FQS9FQTAxNS8xLzkzOTE0IiwNCiAgIkRpc3RyaWJ1dGlvblVuaXF1ZUlkIjogImYwODkyOWM4LWE0NzUtZWQxMS04MTljLTAwMGQzYTllYjQ3NCIsDQogICJFbWFpbEFkZHJlc3MiOiAiZ2xlbmFuZGVyc29uQGludGVncmEubmV0Ig0KfQ%3D%3D&amp;hmac=eRY8aq69fSVeq_nB60Ahe_XbplW5tU07uLBXGRD5Yu8=&amp;emci=3c69de40-dc74-ed11-819c-000d3a9eb474&amp;emdi=f08929c8-a475-ed11-819c-000d3a9eb474&amp;ceid=10196583\">here <\/a><\/strong>to contact your senators.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>Solitary confinement is actually torture.\u00a0 Here are info and a link to federal legislation:<\/h3>\n<p>In mid-July 2022, twenty-nine national religious organizations sent <a href=\"https:\/\/default.salsalabs.org\/T2caa4e56-626c-4175-9ccd-d4b0c39c6159\/c6d1d15f-c360-4f49-b92e-14169bcfb558\">this letter<\/a> to Members of the House of Representatives calling on them to co-sponsor H.R. 8048, the <em><a href=\"https:\/\/default.salsalabs.org\/T6d46d393-96d5-4e29-b8c9-73506d056d9b\/c6d1d15f-c360-4f49-b92e-14169bcfb558\">Solitary Confinement Study and Reform Act<\/a><\/em>.
