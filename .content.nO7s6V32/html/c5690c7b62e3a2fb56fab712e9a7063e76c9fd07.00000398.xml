					<description><![CDATA[When the U.S. was in the process of losing its 20-year war in Afghanistan – one of the poorest nations on earth – I kept thinking of similarities with the U.S.’s ongoing cruelty and violence and war crimes in Vietnam from the 1940s to 1975.  (Vietnam also was a very poor nation, but Vietnam’s people defeated the world’s most powerful military decades before Afghanistan did that to the U.S.) Mainstream U.S. news media have a very long record of kowtowing to U.S. foreign policy instead of reporting critical and true information.  Most schools’ history classes run behind schedule in the <a class="mh-excerpt-more" href="/vietnam-what-most-people-dont-know-and-similarities-to-afghanistan" title="Vietnam &#8212; What most people don&#8217;t know &#8212; And similarities to Afghanistan">[...]</a>]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[For a very long time the U.S. had a &#8220;War Department,&#8221; but we conducted very few foreign wars. In 1947 Congress changed it to the &#8220;Department of Defense,&#8221; and we have conducted many, many wars since then, including our 2-decades-long Endless War against &#8220;terrorism.&#8221; Sensible people want to replace the U.S.&#8217;s chronically aggressive and violently militaristic foreign policy. The diagram linked here can help us figure out strategies for doing that.  It is fun to bring a few friends together to work through this exercise together.  Also, it can be useful for you to work with it alone.  Creative insights <a class="mh-excerpt-more" href="/this-clever-diagram-can-help-us-strategize-how-to-change-to-a-peaceful-foreign-policy" title="This clever diagram can help us strategize how to change to a peaceful foreign policy.">[...]</a>]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Some people who are concerned about the climate urge nuclear power as an alternative. However, that is not really practical for a number of reasons, including the 12 very compelling reasons in the document at the link below. Nuclear power is not only extremely dangerous and extremely expensive, but it entails huge costs and responsibilities that are usually ignored or downplayed in advance. Vietnam was considering nuclear power, but a delegation from other nations talked with them and presented 12 very compelling points listed in this article. With this information, Vietnam decided to REJECT nuclear power. Other nations and regions <a class="mh-excerpt-more" href="/nuclear-power-is-not-an-alternative-to-fossil-fuels-here-is-why-vietnam-rejected-nuclear-power" title="Nuclear power is NOT an alternative to fossil fuels.

					<description><![CDATA[One of the recurring themes in the Olympia Fellowship of Reconciliation&#8217;s TV series is that we are all interconnected. No matter what issue we address on one program or another, we find ourselves affirming our common humanity – across nations, across social and economic groups, and so forth. Olympia FOR&#8217;s TV program for April 2011 took a fresh look at people who are in the military on active duty – and veterans who have served in the military. While the peace movement opposes wars and our violent foreign policy, we recognize that the individuals who serve or have served in <a class="mh-excerpt-more" href="/tv-soldiers-wounds-one-cost-of-war-that-never-ends" title="&#8220;Soldiers&#8217; Wounds:  One Cost of War that Never Ends&#8221;">[...]</a>]]></description>

To read a more thorough summary than the brief summary shown below (and sources of more information), click Program Description &#8212; July 2014 for .pdf The Olympia Fellowship of Reconciliation’s July 2014 TV program features a warm and frank conversation with Larry Kerschner, a Vietnam veteran who started working for peace and social justice a few years after returning – and has been accomplishing more and more ever since. Drawing upon his religious roots and his experiences in the army, Larry has developed himself into a wise, compassionate, and courageous peace activist who <a class="mh-excerpt-more" href="/tv-a-vietnam-veteran-now-works-for-peace" title="TV:  &#8220;A Vietnam Veteran Now Works for Peace&#8221;">[...]</a>]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Fifty years ago the U.S. was massively escalating the war in Vietnam. Recently the Pentagon launched an expensive propaganda campaign to whitewash what really happened and to glorify the Vietnam War as a noble effort. The Olympia Fellowship of Reconciliation’s May 2016 TV program counters that with truthful information that the Pentagon does not want you to know. Two guests – Larry Kerschner and Mark Fleming – help us explore this topic.  Both guests served in the U.S. army in Vietnam.  Both went back to Vietnam recently for peace-related purposes. Both are active with Veterans for Peace (VFP) and with <a class="mh-excerpt-more" href="/tv-vietnam-war-what-really-happened" title="TV:  &#8220;Vietnam War:  What REALLY Happened&#8221;">[...]</a>]]></description>
