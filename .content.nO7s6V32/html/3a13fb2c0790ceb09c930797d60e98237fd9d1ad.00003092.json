Several days of high overnight temperatures provided little respite.<\/p>\n<p>Now new research shows the extreme heat discolored, damaged and killed some of the region\u2019s ubiquitous evergreens.<\/p>\n<p>Coastal Douglas fir and western hemlock plantations in Oregon and Washington shouldered some of the most extensive visible impacts of the so-called heat dome, when a high pressure system parked itself atop the region.\u00a0The trees were visibly scorched by the heat within days and some within hours, researchers say in a\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/academic.oup.com\/treephys\/advance-article-abstract\/doi\/10.1093\/treephys\/tpac143\/6972261\">paper<\/a>\u00a0published in Tree Physiology last month.<\/p>\n<p>The research, led by Christopher Still of the Oregon State University College of Forestry, responded to a\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/35084498\/\">2022 study<\/a>\u00a0that concluded the trees were damaged as a result of drought and an inability of trees to release water vapor to cool down.<\/p>\n<p>While drought was a factor, the new research suggests the main issue was most likely direct heat damage. As summers in the Pacific Northwest trend hotter, researchers and state forestry leaders are trying to understand how trees west of the Cascade crest will fare.\u00a0<span data-st-annotation-ref=\"b5c2e7\">Trees play a critical role in reducing erosion, improving water quality and sequestering carbon, and if they\u2019re damaged, climate change and its impacts would intensify.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>The June 2021 heat dome was among the most extreme heat waves ever recorded globally and the most intense in the observational record for the region.<\/p>\n<p>Max temperatures were about 30 degrees above the average of the hottest months over the past decade. The highest temperature was 61 degrees hotter than the average, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.climatehubs.usda.gov\/hubs\/northwest\/topic\/2021-northwest-heat-dome-causes-impacts-and-future-outlook\">Northwest Climate Hub<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Extreme heat can be deadly to leaf tissue even in short bursts, according to the new study. That heat can increase water loss at the branch, tree and ecosystem scales.<\/p>\n<p>Trees in areas where the sun is always beating down at the hottest part of the day \u2014 on south- and west-facing slopes, and with exposed edges near roads \u2014 had the greatest visible damage after the heat dome.<\/p>\n<p>Tree species from warmer climates did not experience as much discoloration, but species from cooler environments had burnt canopies. Conversations among researchers, foresters and landowners revealed that even well-irrigated Christmas tree farms suffered damage.<\/p>\n<p>The researchers didn\u2019t rule out drought, but said extreme heat is the best explanation for the scorch seen throughout the Pacific Northwest during and after the heat dome. They called for future research to disentangle stressors like extreme heat and drought, and look into how trees have evolved to be resilient under different conditions.<\/p>\n<p>Tamir Klein, a tree eco-physiologist who heads the Weizmann Tree Lab in Israel, was the lead researcher on the 2022 article that concluded the trees\u2019 damage was the result of drought and failed transpiration.<\/p>\n<p>Klein said he agrees with his colleagues\u2019 interpretation that the damage was the result of both heat and drought but wants to know what mechanisms lead to the observed browning. How can trees\u2019 biological processes related to drought response be disentangled from those related to heat?<\/p>\n<p>And, Klein said, he wants to know what species are better equipped for extreme heat, and how the leaf damage threshold varies by species. Now he and his colleagues are collaborating on a follow-up review on how leaves regulate heat.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWorking together,\u201d Klein said in an email, \u201cwe expect to fill some of these gaps in the coming years.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>In 2021, the state Department of Natural Resources flew aerial surveys of federal, tribal, state and private lands. They mapped about 84,000 acres of heat-scorched damage \u2014 all of it in Western Washington. Douglas fir, western hemlock and western red cedar saw the worst of it.<\/p>\n<p>In Eastern Washington, trees have likely adapted to higher temperatures in June. But trees in Western Washington have never really experienced anything like it, said Glenn Kohler, a forest entomologist with DNR.<\/p>\n<p>When the state flew the survey again in 2022, the trees looked mostly fine.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThey\u2019re generally green and growing,\u201d Kohler said. \u201cBut those branch tips that were heavily damaged are still dead.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>There\u2019s no indication the heat wave killed the trees, but it may take time to understand the full impact.<\/p>\n<p>Once a tree experiences a \u201cstress event\u201d like extreme temperatures, it may survive. But when that stressor is coupled with others like severe drought and more extreme heat events, the damage may build up. Western red cedar and western hemlock are not drought-tolerant, Kohler said. And research suggests much of the\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.seattletimes.com\/seattle-news\/environment\/has-this-iconic-northwest-tree-reached-a-tipping-point\/\">red cedar mortality<\/a>\u00a0is drought-driven.<\/p>\n<p>Meanwhile, bark beetles often take advantage of weak, stressed trees that can\u2019t defend themselves. Once a tree has been invaded, it will die.<\/p>\n<p>The long-term impacts take a few years to materialize, Kohler said.\u00a0But hopefully, he said, extreme heat won\u2019t be an annual occurrence.<\/p>\n<p>The conditions aligned just perfectly to create the extreme heat wave of June 2021, said Reid Wolcott, warning coordination meteorologist for the National Weather Service.<\/p>\n<p>The high pressure system that developed was akin to something that may be seen in the desert, he said. It blocked cooling marine air and prevented clouds from forming, allowing the sun to directly warm the air and land.<\/p>\n<p>And the temperature continued to build each day. The longer the heat event, the more extreme, he said.<\/p>\n<p>While the heat dome may be an isolated event, the climatological record shows temperatures increasing over time.<\/p>\n<p>In the past two decades, Washington has seen seven of its 10 hottest years since 1895. And in 2022, the state saw a record number of days at or over 90 degrees, coupled with the driest June to October on record.<\/p>\n<p>The red-tipped trees are just one of the latest iterations of the visible impacts of climate change.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s not unlikely that the conditions will align to create more extreme heat events like the heat dome, Wolcott said. The hottest months will likely continue to get hotter, and especially in urbanized areas that lack green space.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cAnd that can contribute pretty significantly,\u201d Wolcott said, \u201cto not only the impacts on vegetation, but human life.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Isabella Breda:\u00a0206-652-6536\u00a0or\u00a0<a href=\"mailto:ibreda@seattletimes.com\">ibreda@seattletimes.com<\/a>;\u00a0on Twitter:\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.twitter.com\/BredaIsabella\">@BredaIsabella<\/a>.\u00a0Seattle Times staff reporter Isabella Breda covers the environment.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<div class=\"mh-excerpt\"><p>The old term &#8220;global warming&#8221; falls short of what is really happening to the climate.\u00a0 The term &#8220;global warming&#8221; is misleading because &#8212; although on the AVERAGE, temperatures are rising &#8212; actually the climate is DISRUPTED in a variety of ways that cause EXTREME WEATHER in every part of the world.
