					<description><![CDATA[Many Americans seem to accept Israel&#8217;s current cruelty to Palestinians. Israel&#8217;s Prime Minister Netanyahu TOTALLY REJECTED a &#8220;two-state&#8221; solution.  He wants Israelis to dominate, with NO rights for Palestinians. Just now I wrote the attached analogy, which seems compelling. I encourage people to read and share it. Native Americans &#8212; Palestinians &#160; &#160;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[How the Vietnam War pushed MLK to embrace global justice, not only civil rights at home It is a radical concept of love that demands we embrace those we know and those we don’t, to acknowledge, as King said, “that all life is interrelated, that somehow we’re caught in an inescapable network of mutuality tied in a single garment of destiny.” https://www.nationofchange.org/2022/01/13/how-the-vietnam-war-pushed-mlk-to-embrace-global-justice-not-only-civil-rights-at-home/ &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Ever since the Civil Rights Movement’s era, I have appreciated King’s strong, bold, radical message. I have read his books and studied him extensively.  I know a number of people who had worked very closely with him during the Movement, including the older white man sitting next to him on the first integrated bus in Montgomery, Alabama, in December 1956. For too many years people want to water him down to the “Dream” speech, because a “dream” is something not real – something possibly for the future – something that does not compel radical change now.  That is why the <a class="mh-excerpt-more" href="/mlk-was-more-radical-and-bold-than-i-have-a-dream-see-this" title="MLK was more radical and bold than &#8220;I have a dream.&#8221;  See this.">[...]</a>]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In the spring of 1968, President Johnson realized that his horribly unpopular war in Vietnam would PREVENT him from being re-elected, so he withdrew from his presidential campaign.  His VP, Hubert Humphrey, became the Democratic nominee.  But instead of listening to the public, which opposed the Vietnam War, Humphrey campaigned as a pro-war candidate. Richard Nixon campaigned as a “peace” candidate with a promise to end the war, so voters elected Nixon, even though he was horrible in every other way. Leading up to 2016, the Democratic Party kept promoting Hillary Clinton as the only candidate it would consider.  (Remember <a class="mh-excerpt-more" href="/when-democrats-nominate-war-hawks-for-president-republicans-win-by-running-as-peace-candidates" title="When Democrats nominate war-hawks for president, Republicans win by running as peace candidates">[...]</a>]]></description>
