Contrary to the cynical assumption that human beings are inherently competitive and cruel (and contrary to the religious assumption that we’re doomed by “original sin”), powerful research affirms humans inherently want to cooperate and be good to each other.  I read the book Humankind: A Hopeful History written <a class="mh-excerpt-more" href="/nonviolent-grassroots-organizing-creates-light-and-progress" title="Nonviolent Grassroots Organizing Creates Light and Progress">[...]</a>]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The &#8220;conventional wisdom&#8221; wants you to think that long prison sentences make the rest of us safe.  That is NOT true.  Long prison sentences &#8212; especially life sentences &#8212; are horribly cruel and unjust in many ways. An excellent source of information is The Sentencing Project, www.sentencingproject.org.  They conduct excellent quality research and advocacy to reduce and eliminate the gross injustices in criminal justice sentencing.  I have read their materials and donated financial support for many years. In April 2021 they reported this:  &#8220;One in seven people in prison &#8212; over 200,000 individuals &#8212; are serving a sentence of life <a class="mh-excerpt-more" href="/life-sentences-are-horribly-cruel-and-unjust-in-many-ways" title="Life sentences are horribly cruel and unjust in many ways">[...]</a>]]></description>
