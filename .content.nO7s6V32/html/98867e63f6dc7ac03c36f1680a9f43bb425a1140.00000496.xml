					<description><![CDATA[For many years I have been paying attention to the rates of gun violence, including murders.  The murder rate had been declining for several years, but just in the past few years MANY MORE murders have been occurring.  The highly publicized MASS MURDERS are only the tip of the iceberg of gun violence. Overwhelming majorities of voters DEMAND Congress pass strong laws, but too many members of Congress are refusing to do that &#8212; either because they support the gun lobby for ideological reasons, and/or because gun manufacturers and pro-gun groups are funding their election campaigns.  Republicans are MUCH more <a class="mh-excerpt-more" href="/gun-violence-including-murder-is-increasing-now-pass-strong-laws-to-reduce-gun-violence" title="Gun violence &#8212; including murder &#8212; is increasing now.

Now President Biden is doing somewhat better on some issues, but he appointed a great many war-hawks to powerful positions, and he keeps taking his advice to pursue militarism and nationalism instead of collaborating well as one nation among nearly 200 on Planet Earth.  A number of knowledgeable persons have said that Biden&#8217;s foreign policy is pretty much the same as Trump&#8217;s President Biden has promised action to protect the climate, but in order to <a class="mh-excerpt-more" href="/the-perils-of-an-america-first-climate-policy" title="The Perils of an “America First” Climate Policy">[...]</a>]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Evidence of Trump&#8217;s cruelty keeps popping up. This just came up about Trump&#8217;s attempt to deliberately undercount undocumented immigrants in the 2020 census. That would not only weaken their political presence, but it would also hurt the communities where they live. The U.S. Constitution REQUIRES an ACCURATE census of ALL persons living in the U.S.  Trump&#8217;s perversion is unconstitutional. See this:  https://campaignlegal.org/update/clc-reveals-internal-trump-administration-strategies-exclude-immigrants-census &#160; Now here is an irony:  Ironically, Trump&#8217;s inaccurate census might have actually hurt Republicans. See this:  https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2021/4/29/2028069/-Many-are-wondering-if-Trump-botched-the-Census-It-would-be-perfectly-on-brand?detail=emaildkre &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;]]></description>
