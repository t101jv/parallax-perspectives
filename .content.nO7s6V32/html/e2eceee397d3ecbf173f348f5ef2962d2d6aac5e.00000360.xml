					<description><![CDATA[Guns do NOT keep us safe: Many people believe that they need guns to protect their own safety, their homes, their families.  Actually, having a gun in your home is MORE DANGEROUS than not having one! Research has shown that having a firearm in your home DOUBLES THE RISK that you or a family member will die of homicide and TRIPLES THE RISK of suicide. These facts came from www.GVPedia.org, which researches and gathers information and supports evidence-based policies that reduce gun violence. The organization says defensive gun use is actually rare. There are about 2,000 verified defensive gun uses per <a class="mh-excerpt-more" href="/some-ironies-about-guns" title="Some ironies about guns">[...]</a>]]></description>

Overwhelming majorities of voters DEMAND Congress pass strong laws, but too many members of Congress are refusing to do that &#8212; either because they support the gun lobby for ideological reasons, and/or because gun manufacturers and pro-gun groups are funding their election campaigns.  Republicans are MUCH more <a class="mh-excerpt-more" href="/gun-violence-including-murder-is-increasing-now-pass-strong-laws-to-reduce-gun-violence" title="Gun violence &#8212; including murder &#8212; is increasing now.

Many of the issues we care about are HUGE issues in which WE are the UNDERDOGS.  Powerful forces created the unjust status quo &#8212; and powerful forces sustain the injustices we are trying to eliminate. Because we are the underdogs in these big issues, we need to empower ourselves and bring many people together so we can organize large nonviolent grassroots movements to solve the problems and create peaceful and just societies at the <a class="mh-excerpt-more" href="/empowering-the-progressive-movement-watch-glens-video-read-transcript-and-more-resources" title="Empowering the Progressive Movement:  Watch Glen&#8217;s video.
