We designed this course to serve people who are relatively NEW to the issue &#8212; and people whose knowledge is OUT-OF-DATE &#8212; and and also for people who are CURRENTLY WELL-INFORMED.&nbsp; <\/h5>\n\n\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Much has changed recently, and dangers are increasing in several ways, but politicians and mainstream news media are failing to inform the public about what people need to know.  ORDINARY PEOPLE NEED TO INFORM OURSELVES AND BUILD A STRONGER GRASSROOTS MOVEMENT TO ABOLISH NUCLEAR WEAPONS.<\/h5>\n\n\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\">This 4-session course presents the serious information in a supportive environment and also lifts up some positive ways people can solve the problems.&nbsp; <strong>We go far beyond \u201cdoom and gloom\u201d to actually empower people to support the solutions.<\/strong><\/h5>\n\n\n\n<p>Four well informed people designed this course and trade off during each of the four sessions so you\u2019ll enjoy a mix of voices and areas of expertise.&nbsp; <strong>We designed this course of four two-hour sessions to help people regardless of how much they have known about nuclear weapons.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong><u>Topics include:<\/u><\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>The evolution of science that led to nuclear weapons<\/li><li>How nuclear weapons \u2013 and the policies for using them \u2013 have changed over the years<\/li><li>New dangers since the 2016 election &#8212;
