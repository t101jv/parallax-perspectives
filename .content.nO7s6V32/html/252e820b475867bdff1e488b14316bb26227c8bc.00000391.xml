					<description><![CDATA[The U.S. has a very long history of arming dictators and human rights abusers. This was already going on long before the U.S. and Britain overthrew Iran&#8217;s democracy and installed the extremely brutal Shah of Iran in 1953.  The U.S. armed that brutal dictator throughout the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s.  After the Shah&#8217;s demise, the U.S. armed Iraq&#8217;s Saddam Hussein so he could fight his war against Iran.  Then the U.S. violently overthrew him and armed many sides in the chaos that arose directly because of the U.S.&#8217;s war there.  In recent years the U.S. has armed MANY different factions <a class="mh-excerpt-more" href="/the-u-s-must-stop-arming-dictators-and-human-rights-abusers" title="The U.S. must stop arming dictators and human rights abusers">[...]</a>]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[On February 1, 2021, the military of Myanmar (previously known as Burma) overthrew democracy and installed an extremely brutal military dictatorship.  The population has been protesting against that, so the military has been using extreme violence to suppress the resistance.  Most of the public&#8217;s resistance has been nonviolent, but &#8212; out of frustration &#8212; some people have been resorting to violence. Of course, this nation had been colonized by a European nation, so that background plays into the current crisis.  The nation exists in the context of other nations in that region.  Mainstream news media in the U.S. have been <a class="mh-excerpt-more" href="/myanmars-coup-much-info-before-and-after-and-insights-into-other-issues" title="Myanmar&#8217;s coup &#8212; much info before and after &#8212; and insights into other issues">[...]</a>]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[For a very long time the U.S. had a &#8220;War Department,&#8221; but we conducted very few foreign wars. In 1947 Congress changed it to the &#8220;Department of Defense,&#8221; and we have conducted many, many wars since then, including our 2-decades-long Endless War against &#8220;terrorism.&#8221; Sensible people want to replace the U.S.&#8217;s chronically aggressive and violently militaristic foreign policy. The diagram linked here can help us figure out strategies for doing that.  It is fun to bring a few friends together to work through this exercise together.  Also, it can be useful for you to work with it alone.  Creative insights <a class="mh-excerpt-more" href="/this-clever-diagram-can-help-us-strategize-how-to-change-to-a-peaceful-foreign-policy" title="This clever diagram can help us strategize how to change to a peaceful foreign policy.">[...]</a>]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In early September 2019 Trump fired his National Security Adviser John Bolton.  Bolton was a NOTORIOUS hawk who kept opposing diplomacy and kept promoting war instead.  He has been WRONG on foreign policy issues for decades.  Finally Trump had found that Bolton was too hawkish even for Trump, so Trump fired him. Here are some articles about this, including articles summarizing Bolton&#8217;s horrible record and the political context for this latest firing: &#160; #1:  John Bolton is an extremist who likes war and opposes diplomacy and international agreements.  A great non-profit organization &#8212; www.beyondthebomb.org &#8212; wrote this:  &#8220;Bolton managed to break <a class="mh-excerpt-more" href="/john-bolton-was-too-hawkish-even-for-trump" title="John Bolton was TOO HAWKISH even for Trump!">[...]</a>]]></description>
